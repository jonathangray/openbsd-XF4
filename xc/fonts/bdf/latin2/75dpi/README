                       Proportional ISO8859-2 fonts
                       ============================

   In the packages times{75,100}dpi.tar.{gz,Z} there are 24 Adobe Times
Roman fonts, in the packages all{75,100}dpi.tar.gz there are 178 fonts
(172 for 100dpi) from the distribution of the X11R6 translated to
ISO8859-2.

                             Installation

Unpack the archive:

    gunzip < all100dpi.tar.gz | tar xvf -

you will get directory 100dpi or 75dpi. Do 'cd' to this directory.

On IRIX, Linux or other systems which have X11R6 or X11R5 and use fonts
in .pcf.Z format in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/{75,100}dpi just run ./install
script. If you ran it from X, it may be necessary to use

    xset fp rehash

to tell X server there are new fonts.

On Solaris 2.x (SunOS 5.x) or ULTRIX you can check whether the script
is correct and run it too. On other systems it would be necessary to do
some script modifications, eg. if your X server use snf then add an
option which will run bdftosnf instead of bdftopcf to the script (and
remove compress).

I don't know how to install the fonts on SunOS 4.x. Maybe somebody
helps...

If you want to use fonts in Netscape, start new Nestcape after fonts
installation and set

Options->Document Encoding->Central European (Latin-2)
Options->General Preferences->Fonts->For the Encoding->
  ->Central European (iso-8859-2)
Options->General Preferences->Fonts->Use the Proportional Font->
  ->Times (Adobe)
