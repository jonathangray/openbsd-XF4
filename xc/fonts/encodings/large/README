Large encodings                               -*-text-*-    
***************

This directory contains a supplementary set of standard encodings to
be used with xfsft.  These encoding files uses extensions to the
encoding file format intruduced with xfsft-beta1.1.3, and will not
work with any earlier version.

The encoding files will properly map both to Unicode CMaps and to
Microsoft-defined locale specific cmaps.


Issues with these encodings
***************************

Please contact me if you find any problems with the encoding files.

GB 2312 (1980): believed to be correct.

Big5-ETen: I have assumed that Microsoft BIG5 is equivalent to
Big5-ETen.  The Unicode mapping may be incorrect outside of the
`common' part of Big5.

JIS X 0201 (1976): I have assumed that JIS X 201 is equivalent to the
first row of Microsoft Shift-JIS.

JIS X 0208 (1983), JIS X 0208 (1990): The Unicode tables are believed
to be correct.  The Shift-JIS tables just perform a change of
representation without attempting to deal between the differences
between the old and revised versions of the standard; the user needs
to know which variant is implemented by the font.

JIS X 0212 (1990): only maps to Unicode, and is believed to be
correct.

KSC 5601 (1987): believed to be correct.  The Johab encoding does not
seem to have a registered X11 encoding name.
