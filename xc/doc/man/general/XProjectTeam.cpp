.SH NAME
XProjectTeam \- X Project Team information
.SH SYNOPSIS
Release 6.4 of X Version 11 was brought to you by The Open Group X Project Team.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Open Group X Project Team was created as the successor to the X
Consortium, Inc., after the X Consortium ceased operations. The purpose 
of The X Project Team is to foster development, evolution, and 
maintenance of the X Window System.
.PP
The X Consortium was an independent, not-for-profit Delaware membership
corporation.  It was formed in 1993 as the successor to the MIT X 
Consortium.
.PP
The X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.  In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded consortium 
to provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to 
support further development of the X Window System.  In 1992, MIT and 
the membership decided it was in their best interests to move the 
consortium out of MIT and create an independent, stand-alone organization.  
All rights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium, 
Inc. on January 1, 1994.  X Consortium, Inc. closed its doors on December 
31, 1996.  All rights to the X Window System have been assigned to the 
Open Group.
