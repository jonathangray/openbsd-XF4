 * Content: This file is part of version 2.x of xautolock. It implements
 *          the stuff used when the program is not using a screen saver
 *          extension and thus has to use the good old "do it yourself"
 *          approach for detecting user activity.
 *
 *          The basic idea is that we initially traverse the window tree,
 *          selecting SubstructureNotify on all windows and adding each
 *          window to a temporary list. About +- 30 seconds later, we 
 *          scan this list, now asking for KeyPress events. The delay
 *          is needed in order to interfere as little as possible with
 *          the event propagation mechanism. Whenever a new window is 
 *          created by an application, a similar process takes place. 
 *
 *          Please send bug reports etc. to eyckmans@imec.be.
