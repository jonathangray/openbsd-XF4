 Review  : - 05/05/2001 (MCE) :
	     . Disable the reading of $HOME/.Xdefaults files by
	       default. It's a bad idea. Users should always use
	       xrdb to process these. For more information, see
	       the comment in src/options.c
             . More general clean up.
           - 16/04/2001 (MCE) :
             . Finished the initial 2.0 work by recombining the 
               pieces into a more understandable structure.
           - 23/03/2001 (MCE) :
             . Started work on the 2.0 version by finally cutting
               the big mess into little pieces and ANSIfying them.
           - 01/11/1999 (MCE) :
             . Added the "-restart" option.
           - 02/09/1999 (MCE) :
             . On UNIX, only prepend the locker commands with `exec' 
               if they actually contain only a single command. (Bug
               reported by Guenther Grau <Guenther.Grau@bosch.com>.)
             . Removed some old and no longer used VMS cruft.
           - 01/06/1999 (MCE) :
             . Ignore any message found during the very first call
               to LookForMessages().
           - 06/04/1999 (MCE) :
             . Minor improvements to the VMS port. (Again thanks 
               to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.)
           - 11/03/1999 (MCE) :
             . Fixed the communication code to always do the right
               thing when handling "-exit".
           - 16/02/1999 (MCE) :
             . Ripped out the use of signals to communicate with
               other xautolock processes. This removes the limit
               on the number of possible messages (yesterday's
               change was pushing that very hard) and makes things 
               more portable as well.
           - 15/02/1999 (MCE) :
             . Added the "-locknow", "-unlocknow", and "-nowlocker"
               options. (Thanks to Timo J Rinne <tri@iki.fi> for the
               original patch (slightly modified by me).)
             . Some minor clean up.
           - 05/02/1999 (MCE) :
             . The VMS port should now actually work more or less.
               (Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>
               for taking the trouble to actually submit a patch.)
             . Fixed an include file conflict on AIX. (Also thanks 
               to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.)
           - 19/10/1998 (MCE) :
             . Added the "-exit" option. (Based on a patch by 
               Yakov Yukhnovetsky <yakov.yukhnovetsky@telrad.co.il>.)
           - 11/08/1998 (MCE) :
             . Include pwd.h to make the $HOME/.Xdefaults stuff
               compile on more platforms. (Problem reported by
               Jens Schleusener <Jens.Schleusener@dlr.de>.)
           - 09/08/1998 (MCE) :
             . Plugged a memory leak in the $HOME/.Xdefaults code.
             . Updated this changelog to always mention the full 
               names of people. Provided I know them, that is...
           - 03/06/1998 (MCE) :
             . Extended the (unreleased) debugging code somewhat.
           - 08/04/1998 (MCE) :
             . Cleaned up some of the stuff that LCLint complained 
               about (but definitely not all of it).
           - 14/11/1997 (MCE) :
             . Read resources from $HOME/.Xdefaults as a last resort.
               (Suggested by Marc Baudoin <Marc.Baudoin@solsoft.com>.)
           - 27/10/1997 (MCE) :
             . Added support for the MIT ScreenSaver extension.

               from the latest VMS version. (Original code
               by Hunter Goatley <goathunter@madgoat.com>.) Untested!
             . Replaced the "-killpid" option with the "-killer"
               one to allow for more flexibility.
           - 10/08/1997 (MCE) :
             . On VMS, use LIB$SPAWN rather than vfork to work
               around DECC/VAXC interoperability problems. (Taken
               from one of the many VMS branch versions.) Untested!
             . Added code to properly handle the -locker option
               to the VMS version. (Based on a patch by
               Erez Gur <gur.erez@a1.tavis.iso.mts.dec.com>.) Untested!
           - 30/06/1997 (MCE) :
             . Added the "-resetsaver" option to aid people with
               DPMS monitors. (Triggered by Ian Rawlings 
               <ian@tarcus.demon.co.uk>.)

             . Allow the user to exploit the entire range of

           - 29/04/1996 (MCE) :
             . Fixed a serious problem with the Xidle support.
               (Thanks to Lam N <lamn@cs.cuhk.hk> for attracting my
