Xautolock contrib directory
---------------------------

The contrib directory contains various patches that other people have
contributed to xautolock.

If a patch is in there, I have for some reason or another decided not
to include it in xautolock proper, but consider it to be sufficiently
useful to other people in order to still add it to the distribution.

Note  that the contents of  the contrib directory are  *not*  part of
xautolock. Each contribution lives under its own copyright(s).

Also note that I do *not* actively support the content of the contrib
directory  (in contrast to  what is the case  for xautolock  itself). 
Use at your own risk.
