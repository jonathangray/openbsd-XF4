Xautolock contrib directory
---------------------------

The contrib directory contains various patches that other people have
contributed to xautolock.

If a patch is in there, I have for some reason or another decided not
to include it in xautolock proper, but consider it to be sufficiently
useful to other people in order to still add it to the distribution.

Note  that the contents of  the contrib directory are  *not*  part of
xautolock. Each contribution lives under its own copyright(s).

Also note that I do *not* actively support the content of the contrib
directory  (in contrast to  what is the case  for  xautolock  itself). 
Use at your own risk.

At the moment, there is only one entry:

 + IdleFile patch (by Andreas Stolcke, stolcke@icsi.berkeley.edu)

   This  patch  optionally makes the  (approximate)  time of the last
   input event  available to other programs.  This is done by setting
   the  last access time on a file of the user's choosing,  analogous 
   to the way UNIX terminal devices  traditionally record the time of
   last input.

   The patch is relative to patchlevel 10 of xautolock, and has *not*
   been verified against patchlevel 11. It may require manual editing
   to make it work. To unpack, use:

     gunzip < IdleFile.tz | tar -xv
