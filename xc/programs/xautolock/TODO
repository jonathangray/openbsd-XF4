The slowly but ever growing list of things to do and things not to
------------------------------------------------------------------

These will definitely be done:

<none>


Someday in the future I'll look into these:

- Add support for the -display option.
- Add a killer notification to go with -kilpid?
- Get the resource management to work properly (no more dummy
  resource class and addition of a proper application defaults file).
- Split it into multiple files (or rather: rewrite it from scratch).
- Consider introducing the techniques used by XSpy.


Probably never:

- Consider adding the -9to5 option suggested by Andrew Miller 
  (amiller@equity.fbc.com) to not lock during working hours.
  It's a valid addition in some environments, but adding it 
  to the "base system" would probably be a case of featuritis.
- Allow logging duration of inactivity?
