This is version 1.0 of FvwmIconMan, an icon manager modeled roughly on TWM's
icon manager. The file CHANGES lists what's new with this version, and the
included man page gives some examples of how to configure FvwmIconMan, and a
description of what it is, so I won't repeat it here. 

FvwmIconMan is contained in the fvwm distribution, but I do occasionally
release preliminary and bugfix versions on my web and ftp sites. This is such
a release. Fvwm2.0.45 was the current version of fvwm when I wrote this, so if
you have fvwm 2.0.46 (or later), then you shouldn't download this version of
FvwmIconMan. However, since FvwmIconMan is usually released with fvwm, the
Imakefile assumes that it is in it's usual place in the fvwm source tree.
Therefore, you need the fvwm2.0.45 sources to compile this. If you desperately
don't want to do this, email me and I'll send you what you need to compile it
standalone (you don't think I keep the fvwm source around all the time, do
you?). Most likely, this version has bugs, and it's quite likely that somebody
reading this file will find some. If so, please email me.

This version of FvwmIconMan can use MiniIcons and the Shape extension. If you
want to use these features, you should have the appropriate defines set in 
the Fvwm.tmpl file. 

If something needs to be tweaked to make this more portable, then feel free to
inform me, and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions towards improvement.

I realize that the syntax for setting options is different from that used by
other modules.

I have discontinued support for fvwm 1. If you need to compile it for that
version of fvwm, send me mail, and I'll tell you how. The version of
FvwmIconMan included in the fvwm 2.0 distribution WILL NOT run under fvwm 1.
