.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xlock
locks the X server till the user enters their password at the keyboard.
While
.B xlock
is running,
all new server connections are refused.
The screen saver is disabled.
The mouse cursor is turned off.
The screen is blanked and a changing pattern is put on the screen.
If a key or a mouse button is pressed then the user is prompted for the
password of the user who started
.BR xlock .

If the correct password is typed, then the screen is unlocked and the X
server is restored.  When typing the password Control-U and Control-H are
active as kill and erase respectively.  To return to the locked screen,
click in the small icon version of the changing pattern.

In the lower part of the password screen a text is displayed.  This
message is taken from the first file of the following that exists:
$HOME/.xlocktext, $HOME/.plan, or $HOME/.signature.

On systems which support new BSD style authentication, the password
may be prefixed by an authentication style followed by a colon
(i.e. "style:password").  See the login.conf(5) for more information
on authentication styles.

.SH "NOTE ON ETIQUETTE"
.I Xlock
should not be used on public terminals when there is a high demand for them.

If you find a public terminal that has been locked by another user and
there are no other terminals available, and the terminal appears to have
been left idle for a while (normally more than 15 minutes), it is fair to
try to reset the session in some manner.

.TP 5
.BI \-delay \ usecs
The
.I delay
option sets the speed at which a mode will operate.  It simply sets the
number of microseconds to delay between batches of animations.  In
blank mode, it is important to set this to some small number of seconds,
because the keyboard and mouse are only checked after each delay, so you
cannot set the delay too high, but a delay of zero would needlessly
consume cpu checking for mouse and keyboard input in a tight loop, since
blank mode has no work to do.

allows for randomness.  The range from the minimum allowed nonnegative
.I count
for a particular mode to the

.I count
) (or maximum allowed
.I count
, whichever is less).
.TP 5
.BI \-batchcount \ num
The
.I batchcount
option is depreciated but should still work as
.I count.
.TP 5

for text3d it is the number of times drawing a word before the next one,
For others it means nothing.
.TP 5
.BI \-size \ num
The
.I size
option sets the size maximum size of a star in bouboule, pyro and star,
size of ball in ball and bounce, size of bat in bat,
maximum size of bubble in bubble, size of clock in clock,
minimum size of rectangles in deco, size of the polygons in crystal and

width of maze hallway, size of side of penrose tile, radius of loop in lisa,
radius of ball in roll, number of corners in sierpinski,
size of tube in tube, width of worm in worm, line width in rotor,
size of cells in ant, bug, dilemma, life, life1d, pacman, tetris, voters,
wator, and wire.  In pipes it is the maximum length of a system.
In atlantis it is the shark size.
In sproingies it is the size of the screen.  A negative number
allows for randomness, similar to
.I count.
.TP 5
.BI \-ncolors \ num
The
.I ncolors
option sets the maximum number of colors to be used.
.TP 5
.BI \-saturation \ value
The
.I saturation
option sets saturation of the color ramp used to
.I value .
0 is grayscale and 1 is very rich color.  0.4 is a nice pastel.
.TP 5
.BI \-erasemode \ modename
As of this writing there are over 9 erase modes supported
(if its not chosen its assumed random).
The erase modes are random_lines, random_squares, venetian, triple_wipe,
quad_wipe, circle_wipe, three_circle_wipe, squaretate, no_fade.
.TP 5
.BI \-erasedelay \ usecs
The
.I erasedelay
option sets the number of microseconds for steps of the
.B erasemode
(a setting of 0 and the
.B erasemode
is bypassed).
.TP 5
.B +/-nolock
The
.I nolock
option causes
.B xlock
to only draw the patterns and not lock the display.
A key press or a mouse click will terminate the screen saver.
.TP 5
.B -/+inwindow
Runs
.B xlock
in a window, so that you can iconify, move, or resize it and
still use your screen for other stuff.  When running in a window,
.B xlock
no longer locks your screen, it just looks good.
.TP 5
.B -/+inroot
Runs
.B xlock
in your root window.  Like the
.I inwindow
option it no longer locks the screen, it just looks good.
.TP 5
.B -/+remote
The
.I remote
option tells
.B xlock
to not stop you from locking remote X11 servers.  This option should be
used with care and is intended mainly to lock X11 terminals which cannot
run
.B xlock
locally.  If you lock someone else's workstation, they will have to know
.B your
password to unlock it.  Using
.I +remote
overrides any resource derived values for
.I remote
and prevents
.B xlock
from being used to lock other X11 servers.  (Use `+' instead of `-' to
override resources for other options that can take the `+' modifier
similarly.)
.TP 5
.B -/+mono
The
.I mono
option causes
.B xlock
to display monochrome, (black and white) pixels rather than the default
colored ones on color displays.
.TP 5
.B -/+allowaccess
This option is required for servers which do not allow clients to modify
the host access control list.  It is also useful if you need to run x
clients on a server which is locked for some reason...  When
.I allowaccess
is true, the X11 server is left open for clients to attach and thus
lowers the inherent security of this lock screen.  A side effect of using
this option is that if
.B xlock
is killed -KILL, the access control list is not lost.
.TP 5
.BI \-vtlock \ modename
This option is used on a XFree86 system to manage VT switching in
[off|noswitch|switch|restore] mode.
.TP 10
.I off
means no VT switch locking.
.TP 10
.I switch
means VT switch locking + switching to xlock VT when activated.
.TP 10
.I restore
means VT switch locking + switching to xlock VT when activated +
switching back to previous VT when desactivated.
.TP 10
.I noswitch
means VT switch locking only when xlock VT is active.
.TP 5
.B -/+allowroot
The
.I allowroot
option allows the root password to unlock the server as well as the user
who started
.BR xlock .
May not be able to turn this on and off depending on your system and how
.B xlock
was configured.
.TP 5
.B -/+debug
Allows
.B xlock
to be debugged by doing all but locking the screen.
.TP 5
.B -/+description
The
.I description
option causes
.B xlock
shows a mode description above password window.  The default is to
show this description.
.TP 5
.B -/+echokeys
The
.I echokeys
option causes
.B xlock
to echo '?' characters for each key typed into the password prompt.
Some consider this a security risk, so the default is to not echo
anything.
.TP 5
.B -/+enablesaver
By default
.B xlock
will disable the normal X server's screen saver since
it is in effect a replacement for it.  Since it is possible to set delay
parameters long enough to cause phosphor burn on some displays, this
option will turn back on the default screen saver which is very careful
to keep most of the screen black.
.TP 5
.B -/+resetsaver
By default
.B xlock
will call XResetScreenSaver.  This may be undesirable with DPMS monitors.
.TP 5
.B -/+grabmouse
The

.SH **WARNING**
.B xlock
can appear to hang if it is competing with a high-priority process for
the CPU. For example, if
.B xlock
is started after a process with 'nice -20'
(high priority),
.B xlock
will take  considerable amount of time to respond.
.sp
.SH "SHADOW PASSWORDS"
If the machine is using a shadow password system, then
.B xlock
may not be set up to get the real password and so must be given one
of its own. This can be either on the command line, via the
.B -cpasswd
option,
or in the file
.BR $HOME/.xlockrc ,
with the first taking precedence.  In both cases an encrypted password
is expected (see makekey(8)).  If neither is given, then
.B xlock
will prompt for a password and will use that, also storing an
encrypted version of it in
.B $HOME/.xlockrc
for future use.
.sp
.SH BUGS
"kill -KILL
.B xlock
" causes the server that was locked to be unusable, since all hosts
(including localhost) were removed from the access control list
to lock out new X clients, and since
.B xlock
could not catch SIGKILL, it terminated before restoring the access
control list.  This will leave the X server in a state where
\fI"you can no longer connect to that server,
and this operation cannot be reversed unless you reset the server."\fP
		-From the X11R4 Xlib Documentation, Chapter 7.
.br
NCD terminals do not allow xlock to remove all the hosts from the access
control list.  Therefore you will need to use the "-remote" and
"-allowaccess" switches.  If you happen to run without "-allowaccess" on an
NCD terminal,
.B xlock
will not work and you will need to reboot the terminal, or simply go into
the SETUP menus, under 'Network Parameters', and turn off TCP/IP access
control.
