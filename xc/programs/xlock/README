xlockmore-4.16: the maintained version of xlock
see docs/Revisions for more version stuff
see docs/TODO for stuff to do :)

I have significantly less time to maintain this but I try.
If someone has some free time and wants to take over... let me know.
(Help is always appreciated too ;) ).

How to build?
-------------
  An ANSI C compiler is required for build.
  motif (and editres) are used to build xmlock and are not used in xlock.
  athena and sxlib are used to build xalock and are not used in xlock.

  Check below to see if your machine is one mentioned that causes
  problems, otherwise it should be easy.  Just to be safe after installing
  test it with something like: `/usr/local/bin/xlock -debug -verbose`

  If you installed this before you may want to back up your XLock.ad file
  if you made changes, since `make install` will overwrite this.

  There are 3 ways to build:

  configure:
    `configure --help` to see options.

		configure ; make ; make install

		For Linux and others you may want something like:
    configure --prefix=/usr/X11R6 ; make ; make install
    that way it will install it in /usr/X11R6 not /usr/local
		For Suns you may want:
    configure --prefix=/usr/openwin ; make ; make install

  imake:
    Sometimes this is not setup correctly by the distributer ... i.e. not
    my fault.  You may want to do these quick edits to the iconfig.h so you
    have more capabilities:

    Do you have XPM?              If so, uncomment "#define XpmLibrary".
    Do you have OpenGL or MesaGL? If so, uncomment "#define GLLibrary".
    Do you have CDE?              If so, uncomment "#define DtSaverLibrary".
    Do you have RPLAY?            If so, uncomment "#define RplayLibrary".
    Do you have NAS?              If so, uncomment "#define NasLibrary".
    Do you have Motif?            If so, uncomment "#define XmLibrary".

    Examine iconfig.h for other optional capabilities.

    xmkmf ; make Makefiles ; make depend ; make ; make install
    or
    xmkmf -a ; make ; make install

  make.com:
    See VMS below.


Note to binary redistributers:
-----------------------------
  Probably should not distribute with any library requirements
  (except possibly XPM, unless you statically link them in
  and with USE_BOMB since it might not run right if you do not know
  if your users will use xdm or not.  For example:
    configure --without-xpm --without-opengl --without-mesagl
      --without-dtsaver --without-rplay --without-nas --disable-bomb; make
  You may want to distribute it with the xlock/XLock.ad file with "XLock."
  instances replaced with "*".  On Sun's, I need it to override the system
  XLock.ad  file.
  Please let me know if there are other concerns.


Likely Problems
---------------
  Make sure you use the new XLock.ad resource file (or at least remove the
    old one) otherwise several modes will not be set up nicely.  This is
    usually put as a file in $HOME/XLock and/or
    $WHEREVER_X11_IS_LOADED/lib/X11/app-defaults/XLock .

  "Key: " this usually means you should get your administrator to setuid
    xlock to root or at least setgid xlock to shadow.  If you do not have
    a friendly administrator it is asking for a key (password) that it will
    save encrypted your $HOME/.xlockrc file.

  AIX (IBM RS6000)
    AIX's "make":
      AIX's "make" can not handle "+=" so if you use the iconfig.h, you
      have to group all your DEFINES into one long line and use "="
      instead.  GNU's "make" solves this problem.
    AIX 3.1 and less:
      it SHOULD compile automatically with -DLESS_THAN_AIX3_2 using the
      iconfig.h, since the passwd struct is not available.
    AIX 3.2 and greater:
      one must have setuid xlock to root if you want to use it
      without being root.
       su - root
       chown root xlock
       chmod u+s xlock
       chmod og+rx xlock
    AFS users:
      See iconfig.h, grep on "AFS".
    Some machines have an alternate password shadowing method, if someone
      figures it out mail me the patch.
    AIX with DCE you will need "-ls" among the XLOCKLIBS.

  Alpha-OSF/1 (Digital Equipment Corp)

    Enhanced security:
      Compile with -DOSF1_ENH_SEC see iconfig.h
        chown auth.auth xlock
        chmod 2755 xlock
      Unfortunately the following is reportedly broken since xlockmore-2.10
      and needs a patch, I heard it produces the following at runtime.
Unaligned access pid=1767 <xlock> va=140489e24 pc=3ff807d9978 ra=3ff807d9880
type=ldq
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

  Apollo (HP)
    Shift-Control-Break is caught.  See HP.

  CDE (DT) Common Desktop Environment.
    Go to the CDE DT CONFIG SECTION of the
     iconfig.h and uncomment (should be autodetected if you use configure)
XCOMM #define DtSaverLibrary
    Here's what it does:
      The DT screensaver is part of the dtwm window manager and what it does
      is create a full-screen-sized window for each screen of your display.
      This is different from other screen savers which use virtual roots.

      What the DTSAVER option does is basically call a DT routine that
      returns the id's of the windows it creates for the screensaver.  Then
      xlockmore will use these windows to display its stuff.

      DT has a program where you can select your screensaver modes (or
      screen saver programs), ala xmlock, and set your screensaver settings.
      It also creates a small window where if you select a particular mode
      it will run the screen saver and display it on that small window.

    Here's how to set it up on your home directory.
      cp etc/dtprofile $HOME/.dtprofile
        This uses a ksh syntax.  If your shell is csh or other change it
        accordingly.
      cp etc/dtscreen.dt $HOME/.dt/types
        The actions points to /usr/remote so you may want to change this.
      After this you need to completely logout from your CDE session and log
      back in so it will read the .dtprofile.  (If you just modify the actions
      in dtscreen.dt you don't need to log out; you can simply restart your
      dtwm.)
    Here's how to set it up on your system.
      edit /usr/dt/bin/Xsession DTSCREENSAVERLIST to contain the
        DTSCREENSAVERLIST stuff in etc/dtprofile
      cp etc/dtscreen.dt /usr/dt/appconfig/types/C/dtscreen.dt

    The disadvantage to the above is some features of xlock are abscent,
      in particular, the logout lab feature.  This version of xlock does not
      hava a drop in replacement for the Screen Style Manager.  Here is a
      work around on Solaris in 3 patches:
      1. Take out Screen option.
      2. Put in /usr/local/bin/xlock as the default locker.
      3. Turn off the default DT locking mechanism.

  Digital Unix
    Reported that 3.2D (8bpp) password screen color map gets messed up
    sometimes when in random mode as it switches from one mode to another.

  ESIX
    Similar to Solaris2.x.  You will need a -DSVR4 to compile.
    chmod 440 /etc/shadow
    if you get libX11.so.xxx not found
      link with the static versions of the X libraries
    chmod 2755 xlock

  FreeBSD
    One may have to setuid xlock to root (are there any objections?).
    Also see "XFree86" if applicable.

  HP
    Shift-Control-Break is caught.  This uses a library Xhp11 that may
      not exist on some systems.  Comment out
        XHPDisableReset(dsp);
      and
        XHPEnableReset(dsp);
      in "xlock.c" if you do not have this library.
      May have to setuid xlock to root.
    The optimizer may break in xlock/ .
    HP's "make":
      HP's "make" can not handle "+=" so if you use the iconfig.h, you
      have to group all your DEFINES into one long line and use "="
      instead.  GNU's "make" solves this problem.
    HP-UX with Secured Passwords:
      Compile with -DHPUX_SECURE_PASSWD and setuid xlock to root.
    HP-UX with Passwd Etc:
      Compile with -DHP_PASSWDETC .
      Link with -lrgy -lnck -lndbm .
    Calls to XSetScreenSaver when using CDE (i.e. not called with -dtsaver)
      is not supported.  This can cause a disruption in the rpc ttdbserver
      system resulting in the CDE lock and exit buttons to fail, 5 to 50%
      of the time.  I am told this will not be fixed by HP, only documented.
      The only supported method of doing this stuff is via dtstyle.
    configure --without-editres   if configure gets tripped up
    I found on my system -g -O trips up on life.c and shape.c ... so just
      have one or the other.  Also had to link with cc not CC or got
CC: error: could not find _main symbol.  You must use CC to link.
If your main is not in C++, a call to _main() is required. (740)

  IRIX (SGI)
    OpenGL works but may be a little flaky.

  KERBEROS
    See iconfig.h (xmkmf) or modes/Makefile.in (configure).

  Linux (Intel 80386, 80486, & Pentium)
    Red Hat and PAM ... may not work ... #define BAD_PAM in config.h after
      you do a configure and before a make.  Then make sure xlock is setuid
      root.
    If you are using elf _or_ shadow passwords:
      xlock should compile with -DHAVE_SHADOW
      this is already forced if you have elf so do not worry, it should
      work even if you do not have shadow passwording.
    If you are _not_ using elf and are using shadow passwords:
      (this old version of shadowing has a _MAJOR_ known security flaw)
      link with -lshadow -lgdbm
    Next if using shadow passwords:
      chown root.root xlock  (or root.shadow if it exists)
      chmod 4755 xlock
      (chmod 2755 xlock may be better if shadow has group read for root group)
      Also check that the following was done:
        Your /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config/linux.cf should have
#define HasShadowPasswd         YES
          This would let the iconfig.h work automatically for compile/link.
        chown root.root /etc/shadow   (or root.shadow if it exists)
        chmod 400 /etc/shadow
        (chmod 440 /etc/shadow may be better).
    So far, Slackware (a major Linux distribution) does NOT come with shadow
      passwords standard.  If you want to install shadow passwords (be
      careful, it can be tricky) it's on sunsite.unc.edu in

    Also see "XFree86" if applicable.

  Linux (Alpha)
    Change the order of XLIB and XPMLIB in the iconfig.h so the XPMLIB
     comes first.  Intel stuff above probably applies as well.

  MesaGL and OpenGL
    I assume the Mesa 3-D Graphics Library for the Imakefile.  See below
      on availability.  Follow its instructions and then go to MesaGL
      section of the iconfig.h and uncomment
XCOMM #define GLLibrary
      MesaGL and sometimes OpenGL are autodetected if you use configure.

  Rplay
    Audio package.  See below on availability.  Follow its instructions and
      then go to iconfig.h and uncomment (should be autodetected if you use
      configure)
XCOMM #define RplayLibrary
      See config directory for example.  (Note: The example files are
      concerned with getting it working ... not security).

  Solaris2.x (Sun SPARC)
    You could use MesaGL or OpenGL.  I found a developers version of OpenGL at
      http://www.sun.com/solaris/opengl/
    Solaris2.6 may not work with rplay.  configure --without-rplay
    If you get something like:
xlock.c:1584: `sigset_t' undeclared (first use this function)
      try removing -I/usr/include from the Makefiles or get rid of -Xc
      in the xlock/Makefile.  If someone figures out a way around this
      in the code let me know.
    To get xlock working with Sun's GL libraries and includes
      If you get "macro `glNormal3f' used with just one arg" ... you need
         -DSUN_OGL_NO_VERTEX_MACROS
      If using Imakefile, see iconfig.h .
      After a make, use on a display that supports GLX  `xdpyinfo | grep GLX`
    Imake will compile with the -DHAVE_SHADOW switch.
    With GNU's gcc, get rid of the "-ansi" during compilation, also
      one may want to get rid of the -xF references in
      /usr/openwin/lib/config/sun.cf and Imake.tmpl if you get a
      cc: language F not recognized
    Solaris2.x NIS+ or not using NIS (/etc/passwd):
      If you use netgroup make sure there is a return at the end of file.
    If your using g++-2.95 or later and have old X11 includes you may have
      to change "g++" to "g++ -fpermissive" in the Makefiles.

  SunOS4.1.x (Sun Sparc & 680x0)
    bubble may crash the xnews server if patch 100444-76 OpenWindows V3.0
      Server patch is installed.  To test this
      `strings /usr/openwin/bin/xnews | grep Patch`
      It would then show Patch #3000-124 if 10044-76 is installed.
    Put in a link from /usr/include/X11 to your ${OPENWINHOME}/include/X11
      to use the xmkmf or use the configure file provided.
    gcc -Wall gives a lot of silly warnings, its safe to disregard them.
    If your using g++-2.95 or later and have old X11 includes you may have
      to change "g++" to "g++ -fpermissive" in the Makefiles.

  Ultrix (DEC)
    I heard that the logout button just kills xlock.
    USE_XLOCKRC feature unimplemented, but may not be hard to do.
    xlock must be either setuid root or setgid authread to validate the
      password on an Ultrix system.

  VMS (DEC)
    You may want to set a few things like vroot, bomb, and sound (see audio
      below) at the top of the file.
    All you should need to do to build the executable is:
        $ @make
    To run xlock a symbol needs to be defined, for example:
        XLOCK:==$H268SYSEXE:XLOCK
      where H268SYSEXE is a logical name pointing to the directory where
      XLOCK.EXE resides. The '$' after == means this is a foreign command
      and VMS makes the command line available to the program.
    If the link bombs out I recommend trying it again like the following:
        $ @make clean
        $ @make
    -allowroot only works if you have SYSPRV enabled which is a bit limiting.
      Unless one uses the privileged install by a system manager.  To do
      this, the following command needs to be executed at system startup
      (i.e. included in systartup_vms.com):
         INSTALL ADD {dev}:[{dir}]XLOCK.EXE/PRIV=(SYSPRV)
      where {dev}:[{dir}] is the full path of the executable.
    The XLock file normally in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults needs to be in the
      directory DECW$SYSTEM_DEFAULTS on VMS systems and be called
      'DECW$XLOCK.DAT'.
    USE_XLOCKRC, USE_AUTO_LOGOUT, USE_BUTTON_LOGOUT, & USE_MULTIPLE_ROOT
      features are not implemented.
    To use audio:
      Set "sound" to be 1 in the make.com file.  Only available on the Alpha.
      To get it work on a VAX some editing of the make.com is needed
        (scan for USE_VMSPLAY)
      The default sound files are hard coded to be in the current directory
        see line 128 or so of the resource.c file but can be overruled from
        the command line or the resourcefile decw$xlock.dat.
      Sounds did not work for me on the VAX.
      It should work OK on an AXP. (Due to a bug in the SO driver on some
        models running VMS7.0, sounds are only available on the headset).
    To use new event loop:
       For VMS7.0 and higher : new event loop is used by default.
         You do not need to install extra software.
       For VMS6.2 or lower :
         You need some UNIX utilities installed (XVMSUTILS).  See where to get
         it below.
         Look at the make.com and xvmsutil stuff.

  X11
    If your using g++-2.95 or later and have old X11 includes you may have
      to change "g++" to "g++ -fpermissive" in the Makefiles.

  XFree86
    Control-Alt-Backspace will defeat locking mechanism and return your
      console back unless you put "DontZap" in your XF86Config file.
      (In X11R5, that would be a "dontzap" in your Xconfig file).
    Control-Alt-F1 (among others) will defeat locking mechanism with
      virtual terminals. This is not too good, right?  If you are using
      Linux, try vlock on tsx-11.mit.edu in /pub/linux/sources/usr.bin .
      The current XFree86 (as far as I know) does not have a server
      extension for catching or disabling VT switching.
    Here is a work around, put this line in /etc/profile:
        alias x='(startx >/dev/null &);clear;logout'
      then use 'x' instead of 'startx' (with no other active VT's).
    Try configuring with --enable-vtlock .  This is experimental and requires
      xlock being setuid to root so there are security concerns with it.
      See man pages for its runtime options.

XCOMM #define XpmLibrary

  X-Terminal
    (My heart bleeds for you.)
    To get xlock to run, run with -remote option or set XLock.remote on
    in XLock.ad .  You might have to use -allowaccess as well.

  tvtwm
    One used to get following error when running xlock (+nolock) with
      tvtwm.
    X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
    What happens is that RootWindow(dsp, screen) fails when tvtwm is
      running.  There is a kludge fix, but multiscreens will not work
      right with tvtwm and xlock. (grep on TVTWM in xlock.c).
    Another option, don't compile with -DUSE_VROOT .  If you debug it
      mail ME -OR- both the author of tvtwm and ME the patch.
    StickyAbove problems:
      Windows in a tvtwm that have "StickyAbove" set to true are still
      visible when xlock (+inroot) is running. If this bothers you,
      don't compile with -DUSE_VROOT .  Is it possible to have xlock
      set "StickyAbove" to true as well?

    -install does not install colormaps.  fvwm will not allow an
    application to install its own colormap.  You could always edit the
    source if you have it, (fvwm-1.24r)colormaps.c, where it says
 if(ReInstall)
   {
     XInstallColormap(dpy,last_cmap);
   }
    make sure this does not happen.

  swirl (and tube) mode
    Use with -install to see colormap change.
    See "fvwm" if applicable.
    "swirl" cycles its colors, except black and white.
    This is easily seen when on a color monitor one enters:
       ./xlock -mode swirl -inwindow -install
    now move the mouse in the window.
    If you find this annoying compile swirl.c with -DFORCEFIXEDCOLORS.
    I hear it LOCKS UP on i386BsdArchitecture and tvtwm.
    With twm (and fvwm see above) the colormap does not change.

  SafeWord
    Edit config.h.in ... uncomment SAFEWORD line near bottom.
    In modes/Makefile.in make sure SAFEWORD is linked in, comment out
      similar link that does not contain safeword libraries.
    Put the cust*.h files in the main xlock directory.
    Use `configure; make`.
    Get back to me if it works or does not work.

  Dynamic Linking
    Using xmkmf -a (MODULE_PATH set in iconfig.h).
    Using configure --enable-modules (MODULE_PATH set in modes/Makefile(.in)
      and xlock/Makefile(.in) .
    GL modes should work but colormap seems to be wrong.  The multiple
      files per mode modes are temporarily excluded.
    How to use elf on the Linux and Sun (with gcc and Gnu's make).
    Uncomment this in iconfig.h
#define Modules
      xmkmf -a # Ignore errors on Sun (should not get errors on Linux)
      Edit Makefile(s) (Sun only, the first 3 MAY be ok if you are using SunC)
        edit out all "-z text -M mapfile"
        edit out all "-Xc -xF -xcg92"
        edit out all "-Kpic"
        edit out change "/usr/ccs/bin/make" to "/usr/local/make"
          so that the "make" path is to Gnu's "make".
      make # Ignore error about -rdynamic
      make install
    This patch was originally written for Linux.  Not all distributions
    have "dlfcn.h" which is needed.

Personal Use
------------
  You may want to compile with USE_XLOCKRC .  xlock will then prompt
  you the first time you use it for a password.  It is then encrypted
  and stored in your $HOME/.xlockrc file.  This is also good for
  users who have an unrecognized shadow password environment.  See
  iconfig.h file (xmkmf) or `configure --help` for an example.
  Please note that it may be rude to use xlock in a lab environment.

Lab Environment
---------------
  The auto logout feature, when enabled, will log out a user after
  30 minutes (by default).  The timeout can be changed or disabled
  with a command-line option (or x resource -- this is allowed because
  the logout button can always be used; see below).  The time
  remaining before auto-logout is displayed on the password entry
  screen.

  The logout button, when enabled, is a button that appears on the
  password entry screen after 5 minutes (configurable at
  compile-time) that, when clicked, logs out the user.  The rationale
  for this thing is that in a lab environment, we wanted a way for
  users to be able to reliably lock their display for short periods
  of time, but still be allowed to have the display locked for longer
  than that if the lab isn't busy.  If the lab IS busy, and there is
  a need for workstations, the logout button can be used to logout
  someone who's been gone for more than 5 minutes.

  Of course, the auto-logout and the logout button are
  enabled/disabled by compile-time defines.  All these are OFF by
  default.  One can also force use these features with a local policy
  of exemptions (e.g. username or group). See the iconfig.h file or
  `configure --help` for an example.  Edit your /etc/xlock.staff
  file to reflect your policy.  If using xdm, you may just want to use
  -DCLOSEDOWN_LOGOUT (or -DSESSION_LOGOUT <- old way) in conjuction
  with -DUSE_AUTO_LOGOUT or -DUSE_BUTTON_LOGOUT.  That way all
  backgrounded processes owned by a user do not have to be killed.

  Don't PANIC, the auto-logout and the logout button will not run if
  you are root.  Otherwise, it will kill all of root's processes, not
  a good idea.  As long as you do not lock the screen (using -nolock,
  -inwindow, or -inroot) the policy of xlock users does not go into
  effect.  If configured with --use-button-logout=-1, the user can decide
  if he/she wants the logout button enabled (not enabled if
  XLock.buttonLogout=0).


xlock still does not work:  :-(
-------------------------------
  If all that does not work you may need to adjust xlock.h, passwd.c
  xlock.c, and resource.c since these files are highly implementation
  dependent.  If you have to make this kind of change to get it working,
  let me know.

  You can try compiling with -g and running it with -debug and your
  favorite debugger, so xlock will run in a more friendly way (i.e. it
  does not lock the screen).  There are also may be compile time switches
  that could be turned on with -DDEBUG depending on what is not working
  correctly.

  Here is a simple recipe:
    Make sure the 12th line in the iconfig.h is a comment
      (This is because the debug library for xpm is not usually installed)
XCOMM #define XpmLibrary
    xmkmf  <or configure --without-xpm>
    edit Makefile  on the line with CC = gcc or or CC = cc change to
               CC = gcc -g -DDEBUG
    make depend <but not if using configure>
    make
    gdb xlock  (xdb or dbx xlock may work too.)
    run -debug <other xlock options you want here>
    where
    print <relevant variables>
      (you may have to use "up" to take you to xlockmore code)>
    Mail me the results.

  If xlock crashes for you when in random mode... try this and mail
    me the results.  (If it runs for a long time partial result will do
    (gut the middle part)).
  xlock -mode random -modelist all +install -debug -verbose
    -modelist all: all modes except blank
    -debug: so it does not lock the screen.
    -verbose: for maximum verbosity.
    +install: so it does not keep changing the colormap


Other things to try: (if you got it working :-) )
-------------------------------------------------

  Check out etc directory for menus and other goodies.

  If you like to check out what xlock looks like on multiscreens and you
    do not have them... but do have Linux and Xnest ... try:
     Xnest -scrns 3 :1 &
     xterm -display :1.0
    And run xlock from the created xterm.  (For some reason I have to do
    it as root).
    If you are using MesaGL, it must be compiled without SHM extension do
      to a bug in Xnest (even in XFree3.3 == X11R6.3) or you will get
      "BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)".

  You may want to change the 1st line of XLock.ad "random" to "blank",
  "life", or whatever your favorite is and copy it to
  /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or $HOME (or wherever your application
  defaults files are) and rename to XLock .

  You may want some of the modes never to come up in random.  This is
  already hard coded for the blank mode.  See xlock man page on "modelist".
  In mode.c you can hard code others by just putting the stuff that you do
  not like in the LockProcs to the end of the static array and in
  random.c increase NUMSPECIAL by the number of new screens that you do
  not want displayed.

  You may want to move xlock into /usr/bin/X11 (or wherever your X
  binaries are). You may also want to move xlock.man to
  /usr/man/man1/xlock.1 .

  If you want to remove some unwanted modes just edit "mode.h" and
  "mode.c" grep the for the unwanted modes.  You might want to edit
  the man page and your favorite make file as well.

  I am very interested in cellular automata.  I am always looking to
  improve ant, life, life3d, and life1d.  If anyone knows any new
  collections (I have lifep.zip (May 94) and xlife 3.0) let me know.  If
  you would like further information let me know.  There are several
  run-time options to check out, see docs/cell_automata.

  Still like xscreensaver better?  (Obscenities omitted ;) ) Try
  setting your apps-defaults file for xscreensaver like:
*programs:      xlock -nolock +grabmouse -mode random

  If you want to hack a new mode check out docs/HACKERS.GUIDE.  Then
  when working, just mail it to me, grep on "Maintainer" for the
  address.

Operation: (Blurb taken from Darren Senn's xlock)
-------------------------------------------------

  Under X, run xlock.  The screen will clear, and some pretty animated
  picture (exactly which depends on which module is active) will appear
  on the screen.  If you hit a key, then the screen will clear, and
  (unless you've changed the application defaults file that I packaged
  with this) you'll get a black screen with some graphics in the top
  center.  These graphics consist of a reduced size image of the module
  you were viewing, the name of the user who executed xlock, and
  password prompt field, and some short instructions.

  At this point, you can either click on the graphic to return to xlock,
  or you can type a password.  If the password is verifiable as the
  root password, or the password of the user listed above, then xlock
  will terminate.  THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO STOP XLOCK WITHOUT SHUTTING
  DOWN THE X SERVER.  That's what makes it a lock.


Resources: (Also taken from Darren Senn's xlock)
------------------------------------------------

  There are two sets of resources for XLock.  The first set are (what I
  call) global XLock resources, while the second set consists of
  module-specific resources.

  The global resources are:
        XLock.mode: This sets the module.
        XLock.font: This is the font used on the password entry screen.
        XLock.background: The background color for the password entry screen.
        XLock.foreground: The foreground color for the password entry screen.
        XLock.username: The label for the field indicating the user name.
        XLock.password: The label for the password prompt.
        XLock.info: The "short instructions" to print.
        XLock.validate: A message to display while checking the password
        XLock.invalid: A message to display if the password is incorrect
        XLock.nice: How much XLock should nice itself.
        XLock.timeout: How long to wait idle at the password prompt.
        XLock.timeelapsed: Message to see how long lock running (yes or no)
        XLock.mono: Monochrome mode (yes or no)
        XLock.nolock: disable the lock mechanism (yes or no)
        XLock.remote: allow remote locking (meaningless under linux)
        XLock.allowroot: allow the root password to unlock (yes or no)
        XLock.enablesaver: allow the system screensaver to work (yes or no)
        XLock.allowaccess: allow other clients to connect while active
        XLock.echokeys: Echo "?" for each password keypress (yes or no)
        XLock.usefirst: Ignore the first character typed (yes or no)
        XLock.verbose: Verbose mode. (yes or no)
        XLock.inwindow: allow the xlock to run in a window (yes or no)
        XLock.inroot: allow the xlock to run in the root window (yes or no)
        XLock.grabmouse: Grab the keyboard and mouse (yes or no)

  XLock has a number of modules which it can display.  (See the man page
  for a complete list).  It turns out that each module is characterized
  by a number of initializations, separated by a number of "draws".
  Each module has the following resources defined:

        XLock.<module>.delay: How long to wait between draws (usec)
        XLock.<module>.batchcount: May mean various things (see man page).
        XLock.<module>.cycles: Controls the timeout of screen (see man page).
        XLock.<module>.size: Controls size of objects on screen (see man page).
        XLock.<module>.saturation: Saturation (as in HSV) of colors to use.


Acknowledgments:
----------------

  I did not write the original algorithms in any of the lock screens
  (except wator, bug, life1d, demon, ant, daisy, and voters), although I
  did convert many of the new ones to run with xlock.  I tried to follow
  the original style of Patrick Naughton.  Updates are made at
  ftp.x.org in directory /contrib/applications.  Many of the additions
  were "borrowed" from xscreensaver (Jamie Zawinski <jwz@jwz.org>).
  Some of the others were "borrowed" from old demos from Sun.  Many more
  are contributions.

  I will consider putting new ones in if (1) they are more or less public
  domain (i.e. BSD, sorry no GNU copyrights), (2) they are neat (I am
  biased towards mathematically based programs (especially the Computer
  Recreations of Scientific American)), and (3) I have the time.

  Also many thanks to the people that helped me countless times with
  xlock mentioned in "Revisions", especially Jouk Jansen, Tom Schmidt,
  David Hansen, Ed Mackey, Marcelo Vianna, Ron Hitchens, and Heath Kehoe.
