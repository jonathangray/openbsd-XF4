BUGS to fix and other stuff to do see docs/TODO.

XFree86 4.x users (see "4.x" in README)

4.16
  ico.c added double buffering to face drawings.  Run like -faces since the
    default is off (still kind of flashy and added late).  Also removed
    pyramid (drawing errors, count = 7) and plane (boring, count = 6) from
    showing up randomly.
  ant.c noticed triangular ants were wrong, reverted some of the code back
    to 4.14.  Also made ants with neighbors > 6 more rare.
  if both esound and rplay are installed, rplay is configured by default.
  t3d.c converted from xscreensaver thanks to Jouk Jansen
    see t3d.c for notes on what is being worked on...
    Still needs to be scaled to window size.
  bomb.c update to get rid of warning and more 2038 compatible.
  juggle.c thanks to Tim Auckland <Tim.Auckland@Sun.COM>.
    Added -pattern option to try out new patterns.  As a juggler myself I
    find this very useful.  Cleaned up some of the release code.
    Now works for patterns with 0's.  Beginnings of a pattern generator
    is in the works.  Maintainer made it a bit more random.  
  loop mode 2 bugs fixed for -neighbors 6
    Minimum size increased for mono because of drawing errors
    Should now work for small geometries like 32x32
  image.c update... needs a fast redraw between displays or the original
    version looks better.  Changed image defaults.
  rotor.c changed defaults.  Should behave more like the Sun version.
  rubik.c 2 bugs fixed with one statement.  Now works for -hideshuffling
    when turning on non square sides and checks that it down not make 2
    consecutive 180 degree turns when scrambling.
  genlauncher (stuff to help me maintain this) updated.
  dclock.c updates so y2k sub mode will no longer appear in random mode
    thanks to Tom Schmidt.
  xglock font problem fixes
    esound implements Enlightenment Sound daemon
    vtproc patch (compares of unsigned to negative)
    thanks to Remi Cohen-Scali<remi.cohenscali@pobox.com>
  new make.com that does not mess up the new users VMS environment
    thanks to Jouk Jansen.
  solitare mode added from the book Object Oriented Programming by Timothy
    Budd.  Added stuff: Mouse interaction, resizing, no initial flashing,
    and now should release memory.
  Added a check for gtkfontsel.h fore configure since glock fails to build for
    me.
  Dynamic linking of modules.  See "Dynamic Linking" in README.
    Now works with xmkmf -a (or configure --enable-modules, Linux only) .
    GL still has colormap problems... do not have a clue.
    random mode fixed so it will not call blank, bomb, or itself by default.
    Problems with multi file (GL) modes, these are temporarily being excluded.
  VMS patches for C++.  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.
  Various g++ Wall warnings removed.
  xmlock NUMPROCS to low thanks to James Hiller <jhiller@crl.com>.
  BAD_PAM ifdefs fixed thanks to Naomaru Itoi <itoi@eecs.umich.edu>.
  dclock HIV adjustment thanks to Kenneth Stailey <kstailey@primark.com>.
  life3d with -mono should look better.
  genlauncher update with new modes, added xglock to genluancher, modified
    text3d, and modified xglock (a lot).  (Still have a question with
    recent Gtk (at least with 1.2.6): when GtkFontSelection is configured
    the corresponding library is added to xglock's Makefile but it is
    useless with the recent Gtks. It certainly needs to be incorporated in
    the configure program.) Thanks to Eric Lassauge
    <lassauge@mail.dotcom.fr>.

4.15
  -install now works for tetris and kumppa using PseudoColor.
  configure updates to allow use of Sun C++ if g++ is present thanks to
    Tom Schmidt.
  configure updates for g++ not to give warnings or errors about old
    X11 include files thanks to Alexandre Oliva <oliva@lsd.ic.unicamp.br>.
  star mode: more enterprises and drawing bug on enterprise fixed
    (weirded out when at top or left edge on Solaris).
  general cleanup: xmkmf fixes, gcc warning in text3d.cc removed, and
    delinted
  NetBSD patch for xlock.h thanks to Hubert Feyrer
    <feyrer@smaug.fh-regensburg.de>
  dclock now has an led option
  bug mode now has triangular bugs.  Well, they are still square but the
    neighborhoods can now be 3 or 12.  Added some extra genes to make
    odd and even locations independent for neighborhoods of 3 (could not
    figure out neighborhood 9).
  ant mode fixing neighborhood 12 (no neighborhood 9 as well).
  #define BAD_PAM if your system (known to happen on a version of RedHat)
    has a bad version of PAM with shadow passwords thanks to Lincoln Stein
    <lstein@cshl.org>
  xlock.c FD_SET now add one to get rid of a EBADF (Bad-file-descriptor)
    error on VMS.  Not sure what the consequences are on UNIX... left alone
    there, thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.
  flag -bitmap core dumps fixed.
  xpm modes: reinitializing just images and redrawing on a colormap
    change is not good enough... I found one needs to reinitialize all the
    variables to assure that the initial info is correct.  For instance, a
    refresh for life mode would come up with a new bitmap where size of the
    bitmap was all wrong.
  Allow for -1 for configuring a button so a button logout can be chosen
    (or not) by a user.  Still can be forced at compiletime.  Thanks to the
    Michael Stone (Debian maintainer for xlock) <mstone@justice.loyola.edu>.
  crystal fix for Solaris.  Lines needed to be drawn without xor or would
    have drawing errors.
  life shooters fixed up for -callahan and -andreen.  Gliders can come from
    6 directions.  Also fixed a deadly core dump or infinite loop where a
    shooter could write a cell out of bounds (in a small window like the
    password window) possibly even for standard life as well (though you
    would need a really small password window).
  life with -fullrandom includes callahan and andreen rules
  eyes on triangular and hexagonal ants, also fixed truchet for trianglular
    and hexagonal (+sharpturn) ants.
  config.sub fixed for linux/arm, also a fix for when USE_XLOCKRC nor
    FALLBACK_XLOCKRC is defined.  Thanks to the Michael Stone (Debian
    maintainer for xlock) <mstone@justice.loyola.edu>.
  eyes grelb now has moving antennas too.  They are down when flying up and
    up when falling.
  text3d and bubble3d now protected from the pipe mode.  Using MesaGL a lot
    of flashing was observed with these modes after the pipe mode was run.
  tik_tak new mode from Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.
  galaxy authorship for work done fixed.
  life grelbs now have moving antennas.  Its subtle but it HAD to be done.
    One can still bring in images and change the default grelb screen.
  fullrandom now uses xbm half the time for image, maze, and puzzle.
  inline is left defined for C++ if using C++ and C for config.h.in and
    xlock.h.  Trips up new SparcWorks C++ 6.1.  Help from Danny Zerkel
    <dzerkel@cas.org>.
  invert C++ compile errors for gcc-2.95.1 fixed by Jeremy Buhler
    <jbuhler@cs.washington.edu>.
  removed numerous warnings generated by gcc-2.95.1 -Wall.  Added statement
    in README about using old X11 include files with g++-2.95.1  (you need
    -fpermissive).
  xlock.tcl update from Charles Vidal <vidalc@club-internet.fr>.
  bat mode now shows the colored mono images half the time in fullrandom
    thanks to Jouk Jansen.
  dclock HIV adjustment thanks to Kenneth Stailey <kstailey@primark.com>.
  xglock fixes for Gtk-1.2.3 thanks to Thomas Brupbacher <brp@cerberus.ch>.
  matrix.c from Jeremy Buhler <jbuhler@cs.washington.edu>.  Password window
   works much better along with other fixes, see comments in matrix.c .
  configure.tcl update with make, make install, and view in real time thanks
    to Charles Vidal <vidalc@club-internet.fr>.
  SUNWspro 6.1 i_twojet.h compilation may be fixed.
  imake patch (decay and unstable) thanks to
     <Matthew_Clarke@mindlink.bc.ca>.
  blank mode: logic was reversed for enablesaver thanks to Eirik Fuller
    <eirik@netcom.com>.
  Kerberos4 patch thanks to Mark Murray
  FreeBSD patch for disabling FPE (there have been a few requests for this),
    thanks to Thomas Gellekum <tg@zabagek.ihf.rwth-aachen.de>.

4.14
  Peter Munster <peter@gmv.spm.univ-rennes1.fr> found a bug with -lockdelay
    and +mousemotion.  Moving the mouse after the delay brought up the
    password window.
  Later, I will probably add "#ident" stuff for all .h files.
    Started but commented out for now since it should be tested more.
  Update matrix in menus, man page XLock.ad, and gui programs.
  matrix: update to make it look more like the movie thanks to Joan Touzet
    <joant@cadence.com>.
  life: added a P88 oscillator to life.c from Paul Callahan
    http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~callahan/patterns/p1/p1.html and a diagonal
    sparker from Tim Coe
    http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~callahan/patterns/dspark/dspark.html
  thornbird: upgraded from author <Tim.Auckland@corp.sun.com>.
  xjack: fix for little window thanks to Jouk Jansen.
  text3d: -message "text" updates from Eric Lassauge and Jouk Jansen.
    Purify errors noted in text3d.cc thanks to Tom Schmidt.
    updates for fortunes from Jouk Jansen
    initialization errors of GLTT library.  Thanks to Jouk Jansen and Scott
    <mcmillan@cambridge.com>.
  dclock: options y2k and millennium from Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com>.
    It uses local timezone and description was cleaned up.  French
    translations by Eric Lassauge <lassauge@mail.dotcom.fr> and Dutch
    translations from Jouk Jansen.  Also Tom patched dclock up for NetBSD.
  flag: descriptions and purify errors from Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com>.
  -neighbors now a mode option.   -mouse changed to -trackmouse
    -mousemotion was getting picked up instead.  -shift, tshift and -cycle
    combined to -cycle for crystal, tetris, and starfish.
  Multiple options use in modes now possible.  Set up only for -eyes for
    ant and bug.  (Also another major test would be an option that passed
    an integer in).  Code stolen from ParseCmd.c from X11R6.4 source and then
    made so argc and argv are NOT updated.  Jouk Jansen fixed if for VMS.
  Jouk Jansen cleaned up the erase modes.  New option -erasetime added which
    will cause the erase to come to an abrupt end on a slow machine.  Default
    set at 2 seconds.  Also made the erasing smoother...   Also fixed a
    problem on starfish when size became 0.
  Resurrected some old code in ant.c so now ant and bug have an -eyes switch.
    (In the case of bug, it does not let the bug see any better, it just
    shows the direction its facing).  So far its for neighbors = 4 or 8 only
    in ant  ... (and bug also has neighbor = 6 setup).  The graphics leaves
    some room for improvement.
  bug now can have 4 or 8 neighbors and restarts if all bugs die (this did
    not always work before).
  -cpasswd will now work if system uses shadow passwords even if not
    configured with --enable-xlockrc .
  matrix mode thanks to Erik O'Shaughness <eriko@austin.ibm.com>.
    Miscellaneous patches to this mode (less warnings, unexpected events,
    leaks thanks to Tom Schmidt, Jouk Jansen and myself).  The font seems
    is from X11.
  rubik.c now supports LxMxN cubes where non-square faces turn 180 degrees.
    (nx2n 90 degree turns or known more generally as "banded cubes" is yet
    another level of complication which I will not attempt... yet).
  fizzle and spiral erase modes ported from xscreensaver thanks to
    Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.
  showmodes.sh fixed... need nawk or gawk not awk
  loop now has a mechanism to realize when the lifeforms are dead.
    Still some futile life is not caught (i.e life that will eventually
    repeat itself).
  A way for users to unlock each others display.  Kind of defeats
    the lock but the unlocked user is mailed and and entry is
    written to syslogd.  Thanks to Mark Kirk <mkirk@pdi.com> for
    his vizlock-1.0 patch.  Compile-time switch for this is GLOBAL_UNLOCK.
    This is probably full of security holes when enabled... :)
  decay update.  Now does not show user screen by default.  +hide will
    decay the screen.  Also want to update it so that it randomizes the
    position of the screen in the little password window when +hide is used.
  bug mode bugfix (fixed a rare segmentation fault) thanks to
    Mike Coleman <mkc@kc.net>.
  Cleaned up a warning in invert mode and some extra files.
  mandelbrot update by Tim AuckLand <tim.auckland@corp.sun.com>
    -binary  Modulates the colours to indicate the "Binary Decomposition"
       of the exterior of the mandelbrot set.
    -dem  Instead of displaying 'escape times', display an estimate of the
        distance between the point to be coloured and the set.
  xpm modes should refresh better now when the colormap changes.
  decay and lyapunov taken out of unstable category.
  lament changed for latest MesaGL version, text3d updates for fortunes
    thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>
  Red and Blue swapped for -use3d to conform with my glasses from Sun,
    National Geographic, and Insight.
  Colormap problems fixed when two xlock (with -install) run (this can
    happen if xautolock is running and you lock the machine manually)
    thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>
  New space mode from <Vincent.Caron@ecl1999.ec-lyon.fr>.  Probably will
    combine the best features of star and space for a new star mode.
    You must compile it in with --enable-unstable even though it seems
    to be stable...
  Changed my e-mail address to bagleyd@tux.org... the old one will still
    work (as long as the new one does).

4.13
  kumppa patch (kumppa wrote only to the right quarter of the screen) and
    make.com fix thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>
  lyapunov array bounds read error fixed.
  New option "-/+description" on by default.  Now can turn off description
    of mode above password window.
  crystal and tetris more xscreensaver more compatible (did not test it
    using xscreensaver).
  PAM ignored allowroot option, fixed by Sven Paas <Sven.Paas@t-online.de>.
  Bernd 'Bing' Leibing <bernd.leibing@rz.uni-ulm.de> fixed a compile bug
    for logout.c that I introduced in 4.12.
  I got a patch from Andrew Sumner <asumner@netmap.com.au>.  This provides a
    a way (simple edits to mode.h) to excluding unwanted modes.  This is a
    global change to all modes (especially random) except the blank mode.
    Also affected are mode.c and mode.h.
  Lost bees now caught in flow thanks to original author Tim Auckland
    <Tim.Auckland@Sun.COM>.  This caused problems on VMS and probably
    would happen on BSD systems.
  lypapunov mode added.  It is really slow.  The way it is now -count is
    set at 600 (4000 is recommended for a high quality picture but this
    takes a real long time).  So far its only available as a unstable mode.
    Needs a way to speed it up (Sci Am recommends a table of logarithms).
    Now with random forcing strings.  (Hexadecimal representation shown with
    -verbose).
  Fixes for invert for pgcc compiler thanks to Tomasz Sulej
    <tay@inferno.mikrus.pw.edu.pl>.
  Thanks to Dan Stromberg <strombrg@nis.acs.uci.edu> for his update to
    mandelbrot.  It now does subregions.
  lament problems with multiscreens fixed and kumppa problems fixed by
    David Hansen <dhansen@metapath.com>.  He also noticed problems with
    life1d.c (SEGV'd in a malloc from XCreateGC), I have not been able to
    duplicate the problem).
  Found bug in xjack.  When in small window a divide by zero would occur.
    Taken out of unstable.
  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl> his new tetris mode.
    It now extensively remodeled after altris.  Taken out of unstable.
  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> various fixes and leaks to
    rubik, lament, invert, text3d, flow, decay, and tetris.
    Also found problems with gltt which hopefully will be handled by the
    gltt maintainters.
  Thanks to Kenneth Stailey <kstailey@disclosure.com> for his "hiv" add-on
    to dclock.  I also added my personal hang-ups "lab" (research animals)
    and "veg" (consumed animals).  Upgraded the last 2 to work off current
    year to get rid of arbitrary start year of 1970.
  decay mode from xscreensaver thanks to Peter D. Gray
    <pdg@draci.its.uow.edu.au> but it does not work yet.
    Proabably will add a nondefault uption where it will use your current
    image on screen to play around with.  New compile-time option to
    activate: "CHANGEME".  Have not tried it yet my machine is real slow.
  Fixed -fullrandom for multiscreens.
  Cool flow update by author Tim AuckLand <tim.auckland@corp.sun.com> .
    A camera is attached to one of the trained bees and Duffing's forced
    oscillator added.  And multiscreen fix for tetris.
  Configure updates
    Various warnings about shadowing and prototyping removed.  Removed -Wall
    on gcc since it creates too much noise.  Will use it privately though.
    configure now assumes latest version of GL for lament.  configure switch
    does not seem to work on my Sun.  Also added a switch for conditional
    compile and link C++ code but not sure how to get it to work in configure
    (see top of configure.in).  (This introduces problems in make.com which
    will soon be addressed.)  I fixed the compile without --enable-unstable :).
    Took out lament and invert from unstable and put in xjack (partially
    put in before) and tetris (not that its unstable but it needs a lot of
    work).  Put it a warning if your using --enable-vtlock that it is a
    pretty big security hole.
    Update for bsd from Thorsten Frueauf <frueauf@ira.uka.de>
  New lifeform for loop.  I am not sure if its ever been done on a
    hexagonal grid (Nov 02 1998).  The hexagonal grid to be is slightly
    more life-like since it maximzes a cell's area while minimizing its
    perimeter.  (Currently working on a triangular version in a hex grid).
    Run xlock with the following "-mode loop -neighbors 6".  Its cells use
    6 states.  Beware, this option is very liberal about declaring memory.
    Its not clear whether this lifeform for will survive on the infinite
    plane forever or choke on its own waste.  loop made them more bomb
    proof similar to wire.
  Thanks to <rastlin@rast.lodz.pdi.net> for pointing out that if DEF_PLAY
    is used it could be made to overflow.  Fixed, not a security issue though.
    Another possible overflow in iostuff.c fixed (Jouk also fixed it too).
  Thanks to <tim.auckland@corp.sun.com> for his fix for multiheaded bug
    for starfish and link now uses thc CFLAG settings.  There should not
    be calls to release_starfish in draw_starfish.
  Thanks to  Tim Rowley <tor@cs.brown.edu> for his new mode "invert", a
    demonstration of turning a sphere inside out without  creating  any kinks
    (two surfaces can occupy the same space at the same time).
  wire upgrades made more bomb proof... possibly an issue on a multihead
    monochrome.
  make clean should now work if ../configure is run in say xlockmore/linux.
  Thanks to Kevin Vajk <kvajk@ricochet.net> for his fix if Xresources
    contains "xlock.mode: Something_really_long..." xlock would memory fault.
  Thanks to Remi Cohen-Scali <remi.cohenscali@pobox.com> and Eric Lassauge
    <lassauge@mail.dotcom.fr> and Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>
    for updates to text3d and configure for text3d.  Also "*.h" files
    upgraded to handle C++ better.
  Thanks to Remi Cohen-Scali <remi.cohenscali@pobox.com> and Eric Lassauge
    <lassauge@mail.dotcom.fr> for vtlock upgrade.
  Thanks to <todd.miller@courtesan.com> for his signature patch if
    a file has a NUL without a newline.
  Added -showplanes for hyper.  Option looks real bad now but it may be
    improved upon later.  All the planes that include the origin are shown.
  Port of xjack.c from xscreensaver by request.  Most of the delays removed.
  configure change, added afs for Solaris
  configure change, removed --without-gcc, now just set CC before running
    configure.
  configure changes for app-defaults and X11R6.3
  configure and util.c change for usleep for Ultrix.
  text3d updates for AIX from Jouk Jansen.

4.12
  crypt(3) requires strings to be null-terminated.  The 3rd character
    should be null.  Does not matter for most implementations.  Thanks to
    Bill Fenner <fenner@parc.xerox.com>.
  configure fix for afs thanks to Charles Hines <chuck_hines@vnet.ibm.com>.
  configure fix for group shadow on linux.
  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl> for the port of starfish
    and kumppa.  starfish must be enabled (using configure --enable-unstable)
    to use... found unstable on multiscreens and possibly TrueColor.
    Multiscreen error (seen on Xnest and real multiscreens):
      X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
        Major opcode of failed request: 2 (X_ChangedWindowAttributes)
    On TrueColor it sometimes says it can not get all the colors.
    Also did the dclock Dutch translation.
  -fullrandom in 4.11 is confusing so I made it a special option under the
    random mode.
  Now can use g++ on Linux.  Working on SunC++.  Many stupid warnings
    removed.
  Thanks to Charles Vidal <vidalc@club-internet.fr> for his genlauncher.
    This tool (in etc) should help me maintain xlock.  Still needs some work.
    (java, dt stuff)  also in xalock and xmlock the #ifdef stuff gets
    stripped.  Also created a new configure.tcl .  Also did the French
    translation for dclock (accents were not available at the time).
  goop -count now has some effect.
  kaleid option for qix.
  Allow customization of .Xresources.  If using configure uncomment
    CUSTOMIZATION  part after running configure in config.h .  Thanks to
    Robert Bihlmeyer <robbe@orcus.priv.at> .  I personally would rather
    "xlock -display whatever:0" to work as it does in the original.  If
    someone else thinks this default should change ... let me know.
  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> various fixes and purify report.
    Patch for root with no password... not allowed to unlock... could this
    be a problem?  Added verbose fix to color.c stuff.
    Also several fixes for bubble3d on SunOS, now considered stable.
  kumppa leak fixes and starfish leak fixes  (one starfish leak remains?)
    Thanks to Jouk Jansen and Tom Schmidt for finding -bitmap leaks.
  Thanks to Remi Cohen-Scali <remi.cohenscali@pobox.com> and Eric Lassauge
     <lassauge@mail.dotcom.fr> for:
    vtlock: xlock now VT lock switch when using -vtlock option. This is
          enabled for linux with the --enable-vtlock option of configure.
          This may or may not work on some versions of Linux, for example
          it does not work on the maintainers machine. :(   (His latest
          did not make it in this release but tries to take care of the
          potential problem of "locking" a vt while another one is active
          (if using xautolock and two X servers for example).)
          I recently changed this option from lockvt to vtlock so I would
          not be confused.
    configure: add autodetection of MesaGL links (pthread/glide/vga)
          Autodetection of pthread caused xlock not to run for the maintainer
          so it was commented out.
    language: configure can select the lang used for elapsed time display.  A
          grammar/syntax problem have been fixed in French language.
          The option selecting the language is --with-lang in configure.
    xglock: configure can search for GTK+. Makefiles are now generated in
          xglock if GTK+ is found. xglock have been adapted to gtk+-1.0.4.
          It is under development.
    ORIGINAL_XPM_PATCH:
          the ORIGINAL_XPM_PATCH define enabling the pixmap icon mail can
          be activated in configure with --enable-orig-xpm-patch option.
    bubble3d: this mode now has now randomly colored bubbles.
    text3d: compile with -DUSE_TEXT and GL but need g++ and the gltt lib.
          configure not set up for this so edit the generated Makefiles.
          This version works better but the Animate function needs still
          some work.
  More language stuff added in resource.c .  It needs a few more German
    translations and other languages too (besides French and Dutch).
    To do more, each mode description would need to be translated.  I
    currently think that would be hard to maintain, but I will not turn
    down a patch (to mode.c) on this if someone really wants to have this.
  atlantis should no longer flash.
  Fix for shadow passwords if the user no longer exists.
  popex (population explosion) and forest (tropical deforestation) options
    for dclock... really depressing.  See dclock.c for where I get my
    numbers.
  Fade out converted from xscreensaver by Jouk Jansen.  Still to do:
    -fade out the session at xlock startup
    fixed one, squaretate to draw with more granualarity so it would
    not be so slow on my slow machine.
  Update to crystal by  Jouk Jansen to cycle colors like starfish.  (Name of
    option changed from -cycle to -shift so +cycle would still work on
    starfish.  Next version the maintainer hopes to have time to fix this...)
  hyper -use3d.  Too bad humans only have 2 eyes...  otherwise I would add a
    -use4d option and have it default to use green cellophane
  -popcorn option on hop works but the output seems different then a picture
     from my copy of Scientific American.
  mandelbrot update by Tim AuckLand <tim.auckland@corp.sun.com>
     changed from cut-off radius from 2 to sqrt(13) to improve resolution.
  Fix for julia has some initialize errors... pixels in upper left corner.
  Fix off by one error in triple_wipe.
  Fix for -fg red -bg green ... fading does not work here.
  starfish taken out of unstable since it is fixed for multiscreens.
    Similar changes for kumppa and crystal.
  Fix for the following:
    xlock -mode random -modelist image -bitmap /nonexistant/
      xlock: caught signal 11 while running image mode (uid 561).
    xlock -mode random -modelist image -bitmap /nonexistant
      could not read file "gublety-gook"
  Converted Jamie Zawinski <jwz@jwz.org> lament to xlockmore.
    This mode I just got working, so you need to configure with
    --enable-unstable .  Needs OpenGL1.1 ... configure and Imakefile assume
    it for now.  Beware of opening doors...
  Also stole Jamie Zawinski's neat depend/distdepend stuff.  This gives
    errors if setup on linux.  If setup on Sun (make distdepend after a
    normal configure) it seems fine.
      makedepend: warning:  ../xlock/xlock.c: 13:
        # error architecture not supported by the Linux C library
  Took out xalock from building by default.  configure gets tripped up
    by a Sun include file of the same name.
  kumppa now changes direction by -cycles 1000 .
  Fixed up distdepend and reorganized dependencies to be the minimum necessary.
  crystal, starfish, kumppa fixes for -mono and +install .
  automata modes to have borders when -neighbors 4 or 8 since the others have
    them.  ant's squares should really be square now.
  Thanks to Marcelo F. Vianna <m-vianna@usa.net> for his new version of
    rubik.c .

4.11
  atlantis mode thanks to Eric Lassauge <lassauge@mail.dotcom.fr> ported from
    Mark J. Kilgard of Silicon Graphics.
  kaleid thanks to Robert Adam, II  <raii@comm.net>.  -fullrandom
    capability added thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.
    kaleid is a totally new version.  Make sure you reinstall XLock.ad.
    May resurrect the old kaleid in qix?
  bubble3d mode thanks to Richard Jones <rjones@orchestream.com>.
    Not sure about the name... bubble is taken and bubbles is taken in
    screensaver ... original name was glbubble.  Seems to give problems
    on SunOS so it must be enabled (using configure --enable-unstable)
    to use.
  hyper mode thanks to John Heidemann <johnh@isi.edu>.  This was built
    independently from hyper.  I did not understand some of the color stuff
    and through it away in the name of speed (quick coding and quick exec).
    Took move_line from the xscreensaver port.
  -fullrandom added to mountain, triangle, and petal for wireframe the first
    2 include a joke... mixed wireframe/solid
  Yet another try to solve the  colormap problems with fvwm and tvwm.
    New compile-time option for this COMPLIANT_COLORMAP.  Currently this
    is off by default since this fails on TrueColor.  (See config.h[.in]
    for more info).
  Fixed white background on goop with +install.  Also some day I have to add
    back some of its xscreensaver options.
  Thanks to Charles Vidal <vidalc@club-internet.fr> for his improved
    xlock.tcl .  He is also starting a configure.tcl... do not expect it to
    work yet. ;)
  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> for fixing up the mailCmd to a
    later point in the password screen since it could take several seconds
    to run with the mail automounted.
  Thanks to Jamie Zawinski <jwz@jwz.org> ansi and mono fixes for flow.c.
    Jamie also fixed global -no- options in xlock when compiled under
    xscreensaver.
    Fixed some compilation problems when compiling in xscreensaver.
    glx stuff is now in sync with xscreensaver-2.17.
  multiscreen fix for DT.  Sometimes it uses the DefaultScreen and sometimes
    it uses all its screens.
  Bug fix, food for bugs not updated.
  configure fix for Linux and shadow thanks to Robert Bihlmeyer
     <robbe@orcus.priv.at> .
  new ant.  Size does not get too small except if the user wants it or there
     is only a small space (iconified).  -sharpturn option mainly for
     neighbors = 6 but also works for 12.  This new option easily degenerates
     bees/ants to create highways.  Also worked on getting the truchet
     lines better... still not perfect.
  fullrandom option now defaults on... this will probably cause confusion
    when certain options are selected but most users probably do not run it
    with options anyway.
  batchcount depreciated ... it still works but not as a resource.  Use
    count.
  xscreensaver/xautolock problem found.  If using a xlock executable with
     xscreensaver see xlock/vroot.h .
  lisa looks a little better.  I messed up the refreshing... oops.
  If saturation not 1.0 it will run out of colors frequently if the colormap
    is constant... I now retry it as 1.0.  (No COMPLIANT_COLORMAP).
  Fix for BSD_AUTH thanks to Douglas Berry <doug@monk.cancom.net>.

4.10
  goop mode added from xscreensaver.
  color background stuff changed around... did I get it right yet?
    I think the biggest outstanding problem is fvwm[2] and that I may not
    have much control over since it does not let me install the colormap for
    the whole screen.
  color background reset for shape so it does not screw up other modes.
  Solaris configure fixes by Tom Schmidt and David Bagley (Imakefile may
    need some work)
  xlock.c and random.c modified to allow -inwindow to pop up only once in
    a multiscreen and work from :0.1.
  Release code patches for bug, life, life3d, triangle, voters, and wator
    to get it to work with the new -inwindow.
  Thanks to Eduardo Santiago <esm@lanl.gov> for his -enablesaver fix broken
    probably in 4.06.
  -inroot refresh problems, clear window was added to refresh
    ant bat bouboule bounce braid bug clock dclock deco fadeplot flag forest
    galaxy grav helix ico image julia laser life life3d lisa lissie loop
    marquee maze mountain nose pacman petal pyro qix roll rotor
    shape sierpinski spiral star swarm swirl triangle
    vines voters wator wire world worm
    Also debounced some modes since they now need a "painted" variable.
    ant, ball, bug, crystal, helix, life, life3d, lissie,
    petal, voters, and wator.
      deco, marquee, nose could be better too.
  debounced puzzle.
  bug more interruptable.
  xmlock and xalock patched to display black screens.
  "xlock -sound -lockdelay 1" fixed so there is no overlapping sounds.
  Thanks to Michael Duane <mduane@metapath.com> for his check mail patch.
    New options added -mailCmd,  -mailIcon, -nomailIcon.  A sample
    check mail is supplied (by Michael) in etc .
    Original patch used XPM.  The code is still there under
    ORIGINAL_XPM_PATCH, uncomment in xlock/mode.h.  This has some colormap
    problems.
  Thanks to David Leigh <dleigh@us.ibm.com> for his AIX DCE password patch.
    Suggestions in README for compiling.
  Replaced MI_WIN_* with MI_* .
  Changed many references from batchcount to count.  -batchcount is still
    used... could not figure out how to have them both work.
  xlockmore can now be is dropped into the main xscreensaver directory and
    have its modes compile for xscreensaver.
    Sync'ed up these modes from xscreensaver-2.16:
      ant bouboule braid drift fadeplot forest galaxy grav
      hop[along] ifs julia laser lightning lisa lissie mountain
      penrose rotor sierpinski slip sphere spiral strange swirl
      triangle vines worm (flag has diverged)
    Various new line width improvements from jwz:  braid size option,
    rotor size option, and lisa randomized linewidth.
    Currently all xlock modes (but random) will compile in xscreensaver.
    mandelbrot and tube will NOT run yet.  The xpm stuff and program
    option of marquee and tube still need to be improved too.
    Could not figure out how to get -no-fullrandom to work if
    "*fullrandom: True \n" is set in the mode.
    xlockmore is dropped into the main xscreensaver directory.  See README
    in xlockmore/xscreensaver for more info.
  Split out utils.c stuff to util.c random.c automata.c iostuff.c.
    Also changed  visual.c to vis.c .  This is all in the name of
    more xscreensaver compatibility.
  Name changes
    -imagefile -> -bitmap  xscreensaver capability...
    -messagefont -> -planfont  probably not used too much anyway
    -mfont -> -messagefont  goes along with -message...
    (This is not compatible with xscreensaver but true compatibility required
    too many changes...)
  Thanks to Tim Auckland <Tim.Auckland@Sun.COM> for 3 new fractal modes
    discrete, flow, and thornbird.  Also wrote a wrapper script that
    may give better performance when using java or netscape... set
    etc/xlock.sh .  Also -name fix.
  Problem with bomb on 24 bit screen on Solaris 2, same as deco problem,
    "fixed".
  Multiscreen error when -geometry is used.  Password screen size would be
    set to the last screen, fixed.
  Thanks to Yoav Yerushalmi <yoav@mit.edu> for Kerberos fix.
  -wireframe options added for mountain, petal, and triangle.
  bad memory reads fixes on ant and thornbird thanks to Tom Schmidt
    <tschmidt@micron.com> and Purify.
  Fixed a bug with penrose where it would stop drawing if clicked a few
    times.
  DPMS (Display Power Management Signaling) Monitor patch thanks to
    Matthew D. Rench <mdrench@mtu.edu>.  I guess it would make sense to
    run xlock with +enablesaver when your using these new options.
    Info for man pages obtained from http://www.randomc.com/~dperr/dpms.htm .
  Fixed program default message bug for marquee and nose when compiled in
    xscreensaver.
  Thanks to Charles Vidal <vidalc@club-internet.fr> for his improved
    xlock.tcl .

4.09
  Fixed some white background problems.
  Fixed flag free bug.  Showed up on Linux and possibly to a lesser degree on
    all BSD varieties.
  shape "fix" on 15/16 bit displays on Linux.  Took away stippling on Linux.
    It will be back when it does not crash.  Also added borders and shadowing
    on shape.
  Thanks to Yoav Yerushalmi <yoav@mit.edu> for adding new resources:
    logoutCmd, startCmd, and endCmd.  Also patched up the .xlockrc stuff
    as a fallback when using Kerberos.
  Thanks to Alexander Knoll <alexander.knoll@hl.siemens.de> for adding a patch
    for xlock to switch to blank mode if a SIGUSR1 is detected and back if
    SIGUSR2 is detected.  This is useful if one wants to used a load sharing
    facility and does not want xlock gobling up precious CPU time.
  qix modified to handle polygons.  geometry.c merged in with a -complete
    option (and with -fullrandom).  geometry.c removed.
  resource.c changed.  Null strings are no longer malloc'd.  life, life3d,
    getText (used in marquee & nose) fixed to compensate for this.  This
    fixed an annoying but tiny (1 byte) leak.
  ncolors on all modes should now be 64.  There may be a problem on linux
    (involving libc6?) BadValue on X_PolyPoint.
  Added LESS_THAN_SOLARIS2_5 switch so that gcc could compile xlock.c.
  xlock -help should not need -remote option if running xlock remotely.
    This was moved for the modules stuff that I have not got working.  This
    bug is still present for modules, if it works.
  Implemented USE_MULTIPLE_USER for acceptance of multiple passwords to unlock
    similar to USE_MULTIPLE_ROOT.
  +install now works again... broken in 4.08.  I recommend -saturation 1.0
    when running in random mode so you get less mono modes.
  Weeding out of ".", ".." `files' fixed for imagefile in UNIX.
  -sequential now goes more alphabetically.
  SYSV patches for VMS thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.
  Image directories no longer need a final slash for -imagefile.
  Fix when compiled with logout button and used in dtsaver on a 24 bit display.
  Finally fixed puzzle mode when moved off screen as in -debug or -inwindow.

4.08
  Patched up imagefile
  Took out MAXSCREENS.  No multiscreen limit now.
  Took out NUMCOLORS.  Put in ncolors as a mode option, range 2-200
  Took out inital point in qix in the top left corner.
  Fixed closedown logout.  Display was shutdown before logout was running.
  New crystal.c thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl> and fixes
    for AIX and VMS.
  Fixes for TrueColor.  Major bug fix for writable modes and TrueColor.
  -imagefile for pacman and eyes.  So far there is no xpm or ras.
  Fixed up configure/Imakefile for Motif2.0.
  Thanks to Charles Vidal <vidalc@club-internet.fr> for his improved
    xalock and xmlock.  His new improvements use the -parent option.
    That option does not appear to work for multiscreens, but I think
    the fix should be on the xlock side.
  Removed some gcc-2.8.0 warnings and a static variable in draw_flame
    (usually not multi-screen friendly).
  Fixed white screens on mono.
  make.com fix for clean thanks to to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.
  bouboule.c and rotor minor initialize fix
  coral, swirl, flag, braid, and strange leak and bad memory reads fixes
    thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> and Purify.
  Thanks to Hiroshi Kawaguchi <hirosi-k@is.aist-nara.ac.jp> for his
    multi-byte character patches for password prompt and marquee mode.
    Set up using configure --enable-use-mb.
  Lint warnings removed.
  Flag patched yet again.  Default set back to xbm for image to get rid of
    the annoying bad colors on the message part.

4.07
  Added ELF patch I received from Adam P. Jenkins <apj@twain.oit.umass.edu>
    in January 96.  At the time it seemed like a lot of work to add and
    maintain since I could not test it.  It needs more work to get it running.
  Changed back some code in resource.c to allow for machines that have
    dynamically allocated IP addresses.  Not sure if this was necessary now...
  Added patch for SafeWord, not tested.
  took out warnings about strdup in flag.c
  removed g++ warnings in cartoon, crystal, mandelbrot, tube, and random.
  Added hexlife rules to life, they both have known glider lifeforms...
    (-callahan and -andreen options).  The callahan option is more developed.
    May yet add gliders coming from top and bottom.
  Changed around sigset_t on the Sun.  It may give lots of warnings on the
    Sun but I think it will always compile this now.
  -imagefile for each mode like batchcount.
  Fixed swirl, tube, and mandelbrot with BadValue in X_QueryColors on
    Solaris2.6.  tube and mandelbrot fixed when static colormap.
    This "fix" probably caused swirl to error out with -forground gray (or
    -background) -install, this was then fixed..
  Changed default for -usefirst .  The default is now on.  I am amazed that
    I have never done this before.
  configure sometimes mistakenly sets up to use matherr then utils.c errors
    out.
  Thanks to Charles Vidal <vidalc@club-internet.fr> for his improved
    xlock.tcl and a more wavy flag.
  fadeplot was blank on TrueColor and there was a dot in the upper left.
    This no longer happens but it no longer fades either.  Added more
    variablity and release code.
  deco fixed some round-off errors (if width or height odd).
  ant's truchet mode turned off if size is small.
  GL modes are not be compiled in at all if there is no GL, same for
    cartoon and xpm.
  sproingies, pipes, and gears caused a Bad match on X_GLXMakeCurrent
    after their release code is run and am running it remotely.
  deco was weird on TrueColor (Ultra2).  Strange repeated rectangles appear
    in the first square (ie. top left) about 1/4 of the time.
    gl modes are not always cleared when completed.  XClearWindow does not
    work all the time. This led to MI_CLEARWINDOW* macros defined in mode.h
    and used in all modes.
    (Fixed flame, turtle, and petal are blank on mono and with -mono ).
  MI_PAUSE removed from all modes since it does not work on multiscreens
    especially with above patch.
  Modified xlock to give a blank screen the glx modes when GLX is not
    supported by the screen.  This is good for multiheaded machines with
    a monochrome and OpenGL.
  Separate LDFLAGS in configure for xlock, xmlock and xalock.
  -mode ant,bug is an error but should not Segmentation Fault.  Related to
    the new -imagefile mode option.  Fixed thanks to David Hansen
    <dhansen@metapath.com>.
  Interrupts for short delays thanks to William Shubert <wms@hevanet.com>.
    Delay for bouboule and swarm changed to compensate for this.
    Currently backed out since it causes problems with random mode,
    (USE_NEW_EVENT_LOOP).
  If -duration is fast, password screen now gets the text info about the
    mode updated.
  -neighbors option for wire mode.
  Stippling for demon mode on mono.
  Use of union for neighbors info.
  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> for adding "default" as a
    visual name.
  Separated escher into cage and moebius.
  Changed the compile-time option USE_MOUSE_MOTION to a run-time option
    -mousemotion.  Added a new compile-time option -DUSE_WINDOW_VISIBILITY,
    which was suggested a while back (Heath Rice <rice@asl.dl.nec.com>),
    allows one to have a window that sits on top of xlock. (This window must
    pop itself in front if it gets a visibility event).
  If xlock fails to get the encrypted shadow password it now attempts to use
    the -cpasswd option, failing that $HOME/.xlockrc, failing that it queries
    the user.  This way, you do not need to choose between to have it
    as a compile-time option.  This is only used as a fallback.  -DUSE_XLOCKRC
    still remains in case that default is prefered.
  Thanks to Charles Vidal <vidalc@club-internet.fr> for his new mode, bubble.
  Solved a bug in flag involving raster files.
  -garden mode for daisy.
  Thanks to Marcelo F. Vianna <m-vianna@usa.net> for his early version of
    the stairs mode, ala Infinite Stairs.  It needs a bouncing ball on the
    steps.... work in progress.
  Configure changes for xalock, rplay, and nas.
  fullrandom stuff for ant, bubble, daisy, and penrose.
  AIXV3 fix for flag.
  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl> for his patches to utils.c
    that allow imagefile to work with the random mode and can now use
    wild cards to choose specific files in a directory.
  Thanks to Leonid V. Kalmankin <leonid@cs.msu.su> for his patch for the
    3Dfx card.  It is not autodetected so FX must be uncommented in
    config.h.in before running configure (or iconfig.h before running
    xmkmf -a ).
  -mode life -rule and -mode life3d -rule3d format changed.  It now
    allows greater flexibility.  Groupings of symmetric neighbor patterns
    are also possible in life.  So far this is only available for hexagonal
    life.  Add -lifefile and life3dfile for the life and life3d.
    They pretty much follow the simple #P format of xlife.
file: glider.life (-rule S23/B3 -neighbors 8)
#P -1 -1

  Added a bit more color to pyro.
  Fixed MesaGL on TrueColor for modes with MI_WIN_DEPTH in them.
  KRB fixes thanks to Robert L. Sink <sinkr@cbl.umces.edu>.
  PAM support thanks to Michael K. Johnson <johnsonm@redhat.com>
   and Marc Ewing <marc@redhat.com>, use --enable-pam .
  Obscure multiscreen bug fix
     xautolock -time 1 -locker "xlock" &
     xlock/xlock -mode qix -saturation 0.4
    Caused a bad window because of a bad property.  This was traced back
    to vroot.h... this stuff does not need to run unless inroot is true.
  Fixed Makefile.in for BSD... hopefully.
  Visual fix if GL is not installed.  Still not exactly right for xpm stuff.
  tube and mandelbrot sometimes did not call XStoreColors correctly.
  star fixes for multiscreens.
  Will not exit out if someone did not set up /etc/hosts file correctly.

4.06
  Fix for floating point error in cartoon for DEC UNIX.
  Assorted minor fixes.  Imakefile and Makefile.in fixes.
  Thanks to Mike Kelly <tfsmiles@ecst.csuchico.edu> for fixing xlock on
    xterminals (caused a buffer overrun ... not enough memory malloc'd).
  In bug, bugs are now stippled on monochrome.
  -modelist allxpm and -modelist allwrite for writeable colormap modes
    added.   I kept it mutually exclusive... even though allxpm modes use
    a writeable colormap (I'll change this if anyone thinks that it is
    confusing).
  Added a feature to my_fopen that allows creation of a new file.  Needed
    for .xlockrc .
  Added DEC, IBM, and SCO bitmaps and pixmaps.
  Writeable colormap conflict should not bomb out xlock.  There will be
    no graphics.  Not sure if the problem is in MesaGL but there is no
    problem in OpenGL.  -debug will print out the error when hit.
    This is fixed in MesaGL2.5 when its released.
  Rearranged XVisualInfo and context stuff.  Should work the same...
    May cause leaks if using < MesaGL2.5.  Hoped that it would fix above
    problem... it did not.
  Thanks to Dan Stromberg <strombrg@nis.acs.uci.edu> for mandelbrot.
    Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> leak fix.
  RAS and XPM added for flag, maze, life, and life1d.  Probably opened flood
    gate for leaks...  flag and scream.ras does not work well yet...
    probably some padding problem...  life and life1d still default to
    bitmaps.
  +resetsaver option added.  If using DPMS, XResetScreenSaver resets
    power timeouts, which may not be desirable.  -resetsaver is on by
    default.  Thanks to Michel Eyckmans <eyckmans@imec.be>.
  New Prisoner's Dilemma automata mode, "dilemma".  Thanks to Tom Schmidt for
    his leak fix.
  New deco and coral modes stolen from xscreensaver.
  Hopefully fixed font bomb on bomb.
  New Purify logs from Tom Schmidt.
  Fixed exposures on dclock, ifs, nose, and strange.  It could still be a
    problem on coral if your machine is slow.  If you use -lockdelay it may
    have to be lengthened.
  Fixed some flashing on multiscreens for ifs and strange.

4.05
  Fixes for bat and ifs leaks.  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com>
    for his purify report.
  Fix for galaxy (floating point error on FreeBSD) with help from Bruce
    Evans <bde@zeta.org.au>.
  Changed configure so that -lgl is only for IRIX.
  sierpinski in 3D thanks to Antti Kuntsi <kuntsi@iki.fi>.  -size 3 it will
    have 3 corners and -size 4 it will have 4 corners... all others cause it
    to pick 3 and 4 randomly.
  Thanks to Tim Mooney <mooney@dogbert.cc.ndsu.NoDak.edu> for his patch to
    configure for Digital Unix and using prefix to set the app-defaults
    directory.
  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl> for his new crystal.c.
    Now all orthogonal unit cell crystals are represented (quasicrystals
    are not).  Fix for bad memory access and refresh.
  Thanks to Charles Vidal <vidalc@club-internet.fr> for his improved
    xlock.tcl.
  Modified Makefiles.in used by configure.  A make can be made in xlock and
    modes/gl directories.  Should be OK now with BSD make but I have not
    tested it.  Also added setuid and password stuff.
  XPM MesaGL conflict lock pick solved by having the iconified window to have
    fixed colors.  This was added to fixedColors in utils.c .  Other writable
    colormap modes were updated to handle this.  This also solves the problem
    of the "black" password screen not being black.  This probably does not
    fix the real cause of the problem...
  Better color handling of OpenGL.  Still not perfect.  GL modes may look
    bad in PseudoColor and tube and swirl (and bat, image, puzzle, and
    cartoon with XPM) may look bad in TrueColor at least on a 8 bit display.
  Many thanks to Jongki Suwandi <Jongki.Suwandi@eng.Sun.COM> who figured out
    what -dtsaver does and how to use it.  See README.
  Fix so that when DT changes the modes on xlock it does not cause errors in
    the errorlog.
  Pipes in the pipe mode going towards "near" and "far" should no longer be
    invisible in OpenGL.
  Put more shapes in tube.

4.04
  Thanks to Marcelo F. Vianna <m-vianna@usa.net> for speed ups in morph3d
    Created the great new rubik gl mode.  D. Bagley made it a lot more
    unreadable but also made it NxNxN.
  fract name changed to vines. If batchcount is zero then each iteration
    will produce a complete vine, otherwise it will produce a portion of
    the vine.  Nice values for growing the vines to be -batchcount 100
     and -delay 50000.  Thanks to David Hansen <dhansen@metapath.com>
  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> for his password window
    patches for server name and mode descriptions.
  Thanks to Christian von Roques <roques@pond.sub.org> for his galaxy speed
    ups.
  Thanks to John Gotts <jgotts@engin.umich.edu> for his syslog display patch.
  Changed flag to allow it to change between image and message.
  New directory structure.  configure still needs some more work to get
    it to make from any internal directory.  configure should now get the
    correct xapp directory.  Many "ideas" were taken from Jamie Zawinski's
    xscreensaver.  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl> for his
    new make.com.
  puzzle should no longer bomb out with BadMatch if in a window.
    Thanks to David Hansen <dhansen@metapath.com> for handling the -inroot
    case.
  Thanks to Charles Vidal <vidalc@club-internet.fr> for starting 2 more gui
    interfaces xalock, this time using Athena and libsx, and etc/xlock.java.
  -parent <window id> patch to be used with -inwindow option.  This option
    will be used on the GNOME project (http://www.gnome.org).  Thanks to
    Radek Doulik <doulik@karlin.mff.cuni.cz>.
  Added 12 and 6 bit for defaultVisualInfo.
  Moved config directory to etc... imake could get confused.
  Fixed color.c so that it could handle the case when all colors are used up.
  sphere.c now can have the shadow in 4 different locations... it is randomly
    chosen when init_sphere is run.  Fixed a bug if sphere was restarted.
  Fixed sierpinski and wire if there are only a few colors.
  Fixed escher.c it had FALSE instead of "False" in 2 places and was
    causing problems on 64 bit Digital Unix.
  Fall throughs in case statements found on hop and ant.
  hop would sometimes give a blank screen for a nonexisting hop.
  hop now centered and scaled better.
  ifs and strange are now reinitialized when refreshed... the size
    of the window could have changed.
  Ideas in DT workaround in README from Wade Wegner
    <wwegner@surveyor.aae.uiuc.edu>
  munch lifted from xscreensaver.
  Thanks to Eric McDonald <e@aw.sgi.com> for his help on the SGI 12 bit
    display.
  Imakefile patch for SCO and Sun with OGL.
  Configure patch for Purify.
  Dave Prosser <dfp@sco.com> SVR4 random image patch.
  allautomata, allspace, allgeometry add.  allstandard taken away.
    This also puts stuff back in alphabetical order except the special
    modes.
  Password window username now displays host and display info.  Display info
    only displayed if significant.
  puzzle patched to handle bomb when batchcount was negative.
  inline patch if set -ansi -pedantic .
  More xscreensaver compatibility.  flag and others need a bit more work.
  Added eyes and swarm mouse options, very similar to the julia code.
  Patch for Solaris2.6 .
  Fix, sometimes flags would have enough room to fly.

4.03
  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl> for VMS GL patches and
    new mode, crystal.
  Thanks to Ed Mackey <emackey@early.com> for taking out some common code
    to all GL modes and placed it in utils.c.  Also found BIG leak in
    gears.c, rewrote sproingies (now handles more sproingies and have
    better explosions and not have 2 sproingies generated from the same
    spot at the same time).  Added many neat things to pipes.
  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> for his memory leak fixes
    to xmlock.c and option.c.  More unresolved leaks and uninitialized memory
    reads are noted in the source.  Handle matherr in utils.c.
    Fixed uninitialized memory reads in pyro and worm for -use3d.
  Thanks to Marcelo F. Vianna <m-vianna@usa.net> for speed ups in all gl
    modes.  Removed conflict between pipes and superquadrics & sproingies.
    Pipes to handle -inwindow better.  Created the great new escher gl mode.
  Thanks to Jamie Zawinski <jwz@jwz.org> for
    VMS hlp capability make -f Makefile.in hlp
    braid spin can go the other way, flag font and image capability,
    ifs and strange less flashy, julia mouse option, sphere draws all 4 ways
    swirl debugged on 24 bit sgi... it needs 32 bits
  Thanks to Curtis Larsen <larsen@rtp3.med.utah.edu> for a new improved
    bounce mode when run in -inroot.
  Thanks to Jeff Epler <jepler@inetnebr.com> for less tight turns in pipes.
  Thanks to Scott Carter <scarter@sdsc.edu> for check that only regular files
    are read in the .xlockmessage, .plan, .signature.  (Tom Schmidt did this
    for all fopen calls except one :) ).
    Tabs here are now interpreted.
  Jason Larke <jlarke@psc.lsa.umich.edu> for his AFS patch so nonsence lines
    in passwd or shadow do not cause the xlock to barf.
  release code now called in finish originally written by Ron Hitchens
    <ron@idiom.com>.
  XSetScreensaver now only called if locking the screen.  Also able to turn
    it off now in blank mode.
  starting to remove the dependencies on MAXSCREENS and NUMCOLORS
  bigcrypt added for HP secure passwords.
  `xlock -mode spline -cycles 1 -erase` fixed.
  boubloule bug solve using -use3d.  all3d modelist option added.
  New mode added, voters.
  life3d.c leak fix.
  Lifeforms added P3 Question, P8 Asym, and P8 Smiley added from
    http://www.halcyon.com/hkoenig/LifeInfo/LifeInfo.html
    life.c can now handle -neighbors 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 12.  New pointer
    algorithm.  Hexagons for life, demon, & ant now look better.
    wator.c can now handle -neighbors 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 12.
  hop fix for multiscreens.  Most of xmartin2.2 algorithms stolen.  xmartin
    was written by Ed Kubaitis <ejk@ux2.cso.uiuc.edu>.
  a swirl fix for multisceens... one screen if larger than the other would
     not reach its maximum size.
  xmlock string options are now all in quotes.
  bitmaps, pixmap and flag links are now no longer destroyed with a make
    clean.
  stderr is used for the VERBOSE stuff unless its informational stuff about
    the mode as in ant and life*.
  tube no longer changes fg and bg.  Should no longer bomb out on TrueColor.
  Can now use Makefile to adjust SYSLOG stuff.
  Found a bug in ant and galaxy fixed on the HP-UX 9.0.
  Got rid of some flashing of the grelb on eyes.
  Reinitialize qix lines on each init_qix call.  This gets rid of old lines
    reappearing.
  Added -imagefile option for bitmaps in life, life1d, and maze.   eyes and
    pacman will require more thought.  flag now can have a runtime message or
    use bitmaps.  Thanks to Jamie Zawinski.
	Put random colors on the nose guy.
	Added -grabserver option for unsecure SGI.
  Bug in strcat_firstword fixed thanks to <Jeffrey_Doggett@caradon.com>
    Fix for ":not found" text that appears after about 40 minutes.

4.02
  Logout patch for SUNOS4, galaxy and life3d leak fix thanks to Tom Schmidt.
    inline and seteuid patches for configure and xlock.h.
  flag-freebsd.h added.
  First mode was not being released in random mode.  Fixed.
  new ellipse code from Dan Stromberg <strombrg@nis.acs.uci.edu> (formerly
    named trig) added to helix  (xlock -mode helix -ellipse).
  -fullrandom option added to make xlock more random.  Thanks to Jouk
    Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.  So far only drift, helix, hop, &
    spline are set up.  Spline in -erase mode has cycles divided by 64
    so it is compatible with +erase.  New options added to hop (-jong
    and -sine).
  Got SunC++, GnuC++, DECC++ errors and warnings out of xlock.c, passwd.c,
    utils.c, logout.c, cartoon.c, clock.c, galaxy.c, life1d.c, turtle.c,
    worm.c, bomb.c, fract.c, tube.c .  It still does not link.
    GnuC++ was tested on Linux and Solaris.  Thanks to Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl> for the DECC++ patches.
  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> for his memory leak fixes
    to gears.c, mode.c, & resource.c.  MesaGL 2.1 has some leaks that were
    reported to the MesaGL maintainer and fixed in 2.2.  Also fixed swirl,
    and GL modes so they always default to the best visual.  Also added
    -visual (available with hackers code).  gears and morph3d fixed to be
    more random at start.
	gears and morph3d multiscreen bug fixed by Brian Paul
    <brianp@ra.avid.com> MesaGL creator.
  Thanks to Massimino Pascal <Pascal.Massimon@ens.fr> for ifs and strange.
  Thanks to Marcelo F. Vianna <m-vianna@usa.net> for morph3d and pipes.
  Thanks to Dan Stromberg <strombrg@nis.acs.uci.edu> for tube.
  Thanks to Caleb Cullen <CCullen@hal-pc.org> for lisa.
	On Solaris, initial random mode was not random.  This was fixed by a
    cast for SRAND.  Also updated references for seconds() from long or
    int to unsigned long.  time(NULL) will exceed maximum signed int in
    2038.
  flag jumpiness and gears -mono fixed thanks to Ed Mackey
    <emackey@early.com>  http://www.early.com/~emackey/sproingies/.
    Sproingies and superquadrics GL modes and -wireframe option added.
    "configure --enable-sproingies"    sproingies is not compiled in by
    default since it may run VERY slow on some machines.  Also the -size
    option may help you here (thanks to Tom Schmidt for this option).
  Thanks to Tracy Camp <campt@hurrah.com> for fract with improvements by
    David Hansen <dhansen@metapath.com>.
  "Minor" security hole noticed by David Hedley <hedley@cs.bris.ac.uk>.
    Minor in that the array is in the heap and not the stack, so it would
    be tricky to write an exploit.  Patched up by David Hansen
    <dhansen@metapath.com>.
  Debian bug report fix Bug#8276: xlockmore: xlock -help should output
    to stdout rather stderr, thanks to Heiko Schlittermann
    <heiko@lotte.sax.de> for pointing it out.  xlock -version fixed too.
  Debian bug report fix Bug#8406: app file was not being read when configure
    was used.  Fixed.  Thanks to Herbert Xu <herbert@greathan.apana.org.au>
    and Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@rosebud.sps.queensu.ca> for pointing it out.
  added allnice, allstandard, allstable to modelist choices for the
    random mode.  Any mode that runs slower than star mode is considered
    not nice.  If gl modes are compiled in, these are considered
    nonstandard modes.  If hackers modes are compiled in, these are
    considered unstable modes.  To get only GL modes try:
      xlock -mode random -modelist allstable-allstandard
    allgl works too if you do not want to type that much. :)
  X11 ico added added dodecahedron, tetrahedron, and the star octahedron.
    -face and other options were removed to ease port.
  -resources now prints out the resources for mode options.
  button-logout and auto-logout rearranged.  Also the logout button should
    no longer overwrite your plan.  See "configure --help".  Note: 0 is a
    special case and handled as infinity.
  -icongeometry 1x1 fixes for bug, hop, and triangle .
  fvwm2 menus thanks to James G. Feeney <james@albion.glarp.com>
  Changed pause on multiscreens so that if pausing the second screen will
    not override it.  Its not exactly right but I am happy with it for now.
  Thanks to Charles K. Hines <chuck_hines@vnet.ibm.com> for fixing grav.c
    bug, casts to unsigned int.
  LDFLAGS used if using cc on Solaris.  There could be library problems if
    setuid to root.
	-neighbors 8 & 3 added to ant and  8, 3, 9, & 12 added for demon.
  Fix on FreeBSD with xlock setuid and xdm for $HOME/.Xauthority thanks to
    Thomas Gellekum <thomas@ghpc6.ihf.rwth-aachen.de>.
  -sequential option for random.  Since the random mode is the most easily
    broken... its good to have repeatability.

4.01
  Fix in xlock.c if the HOME variable is not set.  Fix in demon.c for
    multiscreens thanks to David Hansen <dhansen@metapath.com>.
  Security hole when xlock is setuid to root found by Richard Jones
    <richard@a42.deep-thought.org> (this affects all previous releases).
		Similar problem found by David Hansen <dhansen@metapath.com>.
    Thanks to David Hansen for his solution of mallocing userfile,
    appdefaults, modname, modeclassname, fullname, fullclassname, buf
    variables.  Also the memory leak on line 831 of GetResources variable
    classname is believed solved (David Hansen again).  In utils.c get_dir
    "dir" and "filename" are forced to remain within the sizes of DIRBUF
    and MAXNAMLEN respectively.
  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> for adding --enable-hackers
    --with-includes and --with-libraries and patching up the handling of
    Editres in configure.in .  A gears and tube bug patched.  Also
    contributed new Purify report showing many problems with the GL modes
    (gears and morph3d).
  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl> for the DECC patches.

4.00
  xlock.html thanks to vh-man2html .
	Patch for SGI to kill the Xsgi process when using 4Dwm thanks to
    Martin Ebert <hi17@iss.mach.uni-karlsruhe.de> and Phillip Moore
    <phil@ERC.MsState.Edu>.
  Fix for colormap stuff, swirl in random mode could crash xlock, error
    made in ALPHA version.
  Thanks to Alexander Jolk <jolk@ap-pc513b.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de> for a
		update to lissie to handle -size .
  Thanks to Sergio Gelato <gelato@spacenet.tn.cornell.edu> for a bug fix
    for galaxy.
  Fixed a "Bad Match" generated with random mode for multi-headed color
    monitors using -install.
  Thanks to Rick Ohnemus <rick@ecompcon.com> for patches to NAS sound
    stuff. Typos were my fault.
  I noticed a problem with Solaris2 and dirent.h .
    xlock -mode image -imagefile ./bitmaps/
    is supposed to pick a random file.  This mechanism does not seem to
    work too well and may corrupt the filename when you give it a specific
    file name.  Therefore for Solaris2, I compile without dirent.h.
    Check out utils.c and grep on Solaris2 to see more...
    One must give a specific filename on Solaris...  here
    config/xlockrandimage.pl may help you.
  Thanks to Charles Vidal <vidalc@club-internet.fr> for starting another gui
    interface to xlock, xlock.tcl, in config directory.  Moved xmlock, the
    Motif gui for xlock (also written by Charles Vidal), from hackers
    directory.
  Robert Duff <duffrd@aud.alcatel.com> patch to randomize the starting
    color of marquee.  Same patch applied to blot, bouboule, braid, dclock,
    geometry, flag, helix, hop, kaleid, julia, qix, roll, rotor, spiral,
    spline, swarm, worm.  On bomb, life, triangle this was not done on
    purpose and on others...  flame and lissie it was done already.
  Leaks fixed in gears.c and bomb.c.  Purify was not used so there could be
    others there.
  dclock should work correctly in password window... i.e. it should not get
    stuck, and randomized initial direction.
  penrose.c  run with -verbose and it will tell you when it hits some
    weirdness (about once an hour) "Dislocation occurred!"
    If it says "Weirdness...." it would have terminated previously.
  Updated make.com to use links instead of copies.  Thanks to Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.
  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> for fixing the formatting
    on the "hours elapsed since locked." message and logout patches.
    Also for adding several options to configure.
  Thanks to Tim Mooney <mooney@dogbert.cc.ndsu.NoDak.edu> for Digital Unix
    (aka OSF1) for patches to the Imakefile.
  Middle button fix and monochrome random mode fix for multiscreens.
    Multiscreen patch for marquee and nose.
  Updated xlock.h not to have a \ at the end a line with a #if.  VAXC chokes.
  Updated size and batchcount in ball and size in pyro.
  Updated mode.c for maze.  Incorrect if XLock.ad was not installed.
  Updated turtle.c.  Incorrect HARTER_HEIGHTWAY mode and float casts to int
    to please the VMS god.
  Updated ant.c to handle more kinds of ants.  Thanks to J Austin David
    <Austin.David@tlogic.com>.  Check out http://havoc.gtf.gatech.edu/austin
  Hackers modes moved to main directory.  cartoon.c may be kind of flashy
    with -install and without it you might not get any cartoons.  Looks OK
    on monochrome.
  audio stuff for VMS is in config directory.
  Updated grav compile-time options now runtime options-> -decay and -trail.
  New "-version" option now pulls the version from version.h.  Also added a
    more verbose option "-verbose" for maximum verbosity.  -v now gets
    version instead.
  New "-sound" option added.  It is off by default.  If on it will only work
    if RPLAY, NAS, VMS_PLAY, or DEF_PLAY are used at compile-time.
  "Feature" where truncated mode names were accepted, such as "-mode s" now
    give an error.  It did not work well anyway (above example ran shapes in
    monochrome).
  Thanks to Alexander Lehmann <lehmann@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de> for adding
    backspace capability Control-H for marquee (but not with -message).
  configure is now used.  At this stage the Imakefile is still probably
    more reliable.  The Makefile.[acc hp std sun] are no longer supported.
    (But are in config for reference).  The Imakefile and make.com are still
    supported.  imake has fallen out of favor with me.  imake is sometimes
    not configured well, its make depend is confusing (some systems it is not
    required), and cumbersome (and ugly) "@@\"'s are used to do more
    complicated things.  And it is not installed on some HP's.
    A few things have been added for configure, but NOT used with Imakefile
    or make.com:
      config.h.in -> config.h  when "configure" is run.
        This file is where the users options are stored.  These may depend
        more on the administrator/user than on the system, but some options
        are not available on some machines.  See "configure --help".
        If this file is modified... a "make clean" should be done unless you
        know what your doing.
      Makefile.in -> Makefile  when "configure" is run.
      configure.in -> configure  when "autoconf" is run.  Note: autoconf is
        a GNU product that may not be installed.  This is need only if you
        update configure.in .
     Although there is some VMS support features in Makefile.in... full
       support for MMS, MMK, or VMS-GNU-MAKE is not there yet.

3.13
  loop.c added, it is not exactly a screen saver, but it demonstrates
    self-production.
  turtle.c added.  Recursive turtle graphics.  The only one that works
    at present is the Hilbert curve (which is may not exactly be
    a turtle curve... but close enough).
  Thanks to M G Berberich <berberic@forwiss.uni-passau.de> for .plan and
    .signature stuff and purify log.
  bomb and signature updates for VMS thanks to Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.
  flag fix for negative size thanks to <Mark_Buglewicz@itd.sterling.com>.
  MULTIPLE_ROOT & passwd in compat mode bug fix and NAS sound patch bug
    fix thanks to Dave Smith <drs@aeolians.bt.co.uk>.
  Thanks to Tom L. Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> for purify logs.
  Many leaks patched thanks to Purify!  grep on "PURIFY" to find
    unresolved leaks.  Purify file is in the docs directory.
  2 problems in the Imakefile cleaned up thanks to Simon Josefsson
    <jas@pdc.kth.se>.
  Patch to allow marquee to handle extended character set >=128
    Alexander Lehmann <lehmann@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de>.
  XPM files now work with -install (thanks to XPM maintainer Arnaud
    Le Hors for pointing me in the right direction).  Managed to reserve
    black and white, but not fg and bg does not work.  Sometimes in random
    mode the colors are not mapped correctly.
  -geometry should now work again without excessive refreshing.
  Refresh update on image.c.
  ball, julia, roll in the hackers directory are probably ready for
    prime-time but have not been BETA tested.

3.12
  swirl will cause xlock to dump core or CRASH OS within 50 repetitions
    when run in random mode, fixed.
  xlock -mode tri -mono  dies, fixed.
  xlock -mode swirl +install  with netscape (stealing colors) running
    is even less reliable, fixed.
  daisy and slip are sometimes in red when there are no colors left, fixed.
  After the delay has expired the first button click only redraws the
    current mode.  It then takes a second click to activate the
    password display.  Fixed thanks to David Hansen <dhansen@metapath.com>.
  Individual -size option added (like batchcount).  -gridsize removed.
    If 0 it will use the bitmap if available.  If negative it will be
    random from 1 to -size inclusive (like batchcount).
  Combined star mode with rock mode.  rock mode removed.
    -trek, -rock, -straight options.  Star Trek features by Heath Rice
    <rice@asl.dl.nec.com>.
  dclock updated offscreen so there is no annoying flashing.  Originally
    submitted by Michael Stembera <mrbig@fc.net>.
  bomb mode back... but its essentials are NOT compiled in by default.
  Patches for SUNOS_ADJUNCT_PASSWD thanks to Mark Buglewicz
    <mark@itd.sterling.com>.
  Many modes patched that did not initialize the redrawing variable.
  Demon bug solved when alternating between iconified window and normal
    window.
  mountain patched so it would not be so slow.
  life1d much improved.  It now has a fade out if it is found repeating.
    Now can break without it completing a whole screen.  -totalistic
    option added (+totalistic -> LCAU collection instead).
  Updated clock to use batchcount  (i.e. many clocks) .. if there are too
    many collisions it will draw less clocks.
  Thanks to Rene' Driessen <rdr@crys.chem.uva.nl>
    xlock -mode puzzle -mono ( -inwindow | -debug )
    will get a Bad Match if obscured (but still errors out if moved off
    screen).
  Updated modes to use size instead of batchcount... clock, flag,
    maze, penrose.
  Updated modes to use size instead of cycles... bouboule, star.
  Updated modes to use size instead of worm's CIRCSIZE, and galaxy's STARSIZE.
  Updated other modes to use size bat, bounce, ant, demon, life1d, life,
    wator, wire.
  galaxy bug on VAX now gone... not sure why...  Disappeared when I added
    temporary sin and cos calculations for efficiency.
  Thanks to Dr. George D M Ross <gdmr@dcs.ed.ac.uk> for SYSLOG (xlock.c)
    and NETGROUP patches (logout.c).
  Thanks to Gabor Herr <herr@iti.informatik.th-darmstadt.de> for pointing
    out that uid and gid privileges should be taken away unconditionally
    after the encrypted password is grabbed.  Otherwise, it may lead to a
    major security hole depending on how it is installed.
  xmlock.c added to hackers directory.  Thanks to Charles Vidal
    <vidalc@club-internet.fr> for starting a gui interface to xlock.  Feel
    free to improve upon it, but mail me your diffs.
  -DUSE_HACKERS compile-time option added (cartoon.c took a step back,
    nobody's fault but mine).
  ant mode with -truchet memory leak found.  Refreshing improved.

3.11
  Ron Hitchens <ron@idiom.com> Updated xlock so it would refresh more
    reliably and handle window resizing and -inroot
  -neighbors is now randomly 4 or 6 if not 4 or 6.  This affects the ant and
    demon mode.  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.
  -help now displays help messages of each mode if there is one.
  Changed _opts to include a separate counter for opts and vars & desc
    since they do not have to be the same if there are boolean switches.
  Added a -truchet option to ant, this leaves a trail of the ant.
    One should probably change -gridsize to see it more clearly.
  Added a -erase option to spline, if used one should make -cycles low,
    say 20.
  My long request for a penrose algorithm has been answered :) ,
    penrose.c added thanks to Timo Korvola <tkorvola@dopey.hut.fi> .
    -ammann will show ammann lines.  These were useful for debugging
    penrose.c .  It is currently my favorite mode.  Once I saw it do
    a dislocation, I think.
  tri.c added thanks to Desmond Daignault <tekdd@dtol.datatimes.com> .
    I would like to see other fractals added to this like fern.
  daisy.c added.  I modeled it after some slow PC lockscreen in the office.
  More 3d options besides rock: bouboule, pyro, & worms.  Rock patched up.
    Now includes overlap color if colormap is installed.  Thanks to
    Henrik Theiling <theiling@coli.uni-sb.de> .
    There is a bug on some machines with rock mode.  A border of red can
    be seen around the magenta rock (which should be blue).  This happens
    on my Sun with the colormap installed but not on Linux.
  Password code mallocs fixed up and BSD_AUTH code added thanks to
    Paul Borman <prb@bsdi.com> .
  2 problems in Kerberos code and 2 in the Imakefile cleaned up thanks
    to Simon Josefsson <jas@pdc.kth.se> .
  Kerberos 5 added thanks to Dale Harris <rodmur@ecst.csuchico.edu> .
  Multi user per uid patch thanks to der Mouse
    <mouse@collatz.mcrcim.mcgill.edu> .
  Now should compile under C++, but it complains about signaling, pclose,
    crypt, and gethostname when linking.
  All modes now have refresh hooks, but some just call the init_ hook.
    lissie, bug, rotor, spline -erase and worm hooks thanks to Alexander
    Jolk <jolk@ap-pc513b.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de> .
    On slip, penrose, and puzzle, I made no attempt.
  All modes now have change hooks.  All except random call the init_ hook.
    So when running a mode you can get it to restart by pressing the middle
    button on your mouse.  This does not work with the password window up
    but probably should.
  Added -debug runtime switch.  Formerly accessed only by -DDEBUG.  Some
    debug switches are still only accessed in this way.
  -rule for life and -rule3d for life3d runtime switches.  Also a real
    change hooks for these modes.  For -rule3d if set to 0 all rules that
    have known patterns will randomly selected.  If set to 1 all rules that
    have known gliders will be randomly selected.
  "xlock -inwindow -lockdelay 10" now should work.
  Sped up sphere by not drawing off screen.
  Added a hackers directory for hackers.
  Added hooks to Imakefile for MesaGL.  No mode uses this yet see the
    hackers directory.

3.10
  Reorganized bitmaps.  All single bitmaps use "image_" inside the bitmap
    file.  They are now organized t-tiny, s-small, m-medium, and l-large.
    That way one can, if one wished, one can use one bitmap file for eyes,
    image, life, life1d, maze, and puzzle at compile-time.
  Removed all references to Scr, screen, and dsp in the modes.
  Release mode stuff added to all modes (except random).  Rewrote image
    initialization for bat, image, and puzzle to make it safe for
    multiscreens (image and puzzle are still not correct for multiscreens).
  Negative batchcounts now allowed, if negative it will be random from
    the smallest allowed positive batchcount to ABS(batchcount), inclusive.
    It is available on
      ant, bat, bounce, bug, eyes, flag, galaxy, geometry, grav, image, laser,
      lissie, maze, mountain, petal, puzzle, rock, spiral, spline, swarm,
      world, worm.
  More mallocing (and freeing) done for bat, bounce, bug, eyes, galaxy,
    geometry, image, lissie, maze, puzzle, rock, rotor, spline, wator, world,
    worm, so there are less predefined limits.  In the case of eyes and rock,
    some limits were imposed where a dynamic number of pixmaps were
    dynamically declared, so that xlock would not easily slow down to a crawl
    and run out of memory.
  bug now uses gridsize.  And to some degree life, life1d, and wator.
    It would be neat if you could choose not to use the bitmaps for big
    windows.
  worm now uses cycles for length of worm and galaxy uses cycles now too.
    rock uses cycles for max rock size.
  One no longer has to hit return twice to unlock using lockdelay.
  flag now uses batchcount for "point" size.
  XClearWindow is used instead of filling screen with a big black rectangle.
  Added -icongeometry option. It has a range of 1x1 to 256x256 .  Position
    information is ignored.  Updated modes to handle weird geometry's bat,
    bounce, braid, bug, eyes, kaleid, life, life1d, maze, nose, puzzle,
    wator, world.
  mountain changed to allow it to be interrupted quicker, (braid and slip
    are harder :) ).
  bounce changed to get rid of drawing errors.  I could not figure out how
    easily remove more without the balls flashing.
  wire mode added based on code from Kevin Dahlhausen <ap096@po.cwru.edu>
    and Stefan Strack <stst@vuse.vanderbilt.edu>.
  lightning mode added thanks to Keith Romberg <kromberg@saxe.com>.
  in xlock.c, in function runMainLoop, reads should be declared not as
    struct fd_set.  This causes compilation errors with Linux kernels 2.0
    and higher.  Thanks to Brian R. Doherty <doherty@rice.edu>.
  "nice" patch for xlock to so that xlock is "not so nice" when a password
    window is being presented.  Thanks to Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.
  lightning, eyes, maze, shape patched for multiscreens.  XPM stuff patched
    for multiscreens (thanks to XPM maintainer Arnaud Le Hors).
    Tested on a machine where 0.0 is black/white, 0.1 is 8 bit color.
    Also random mode does not use the correct initial values of modes on
    multiscreens.  Testing on multiscreen thanks to Mark Wedel
    <mwedel@pyramid.com>.
  Long standing bug fixed (>= before MAXBATCH) for flame.c thanks to Ron
    Charlton <crc@ornl.gov>.
  puzzle when in -inwindow or compiled with -DDEBUG and moved off screen
    will not bomb out unless it is using an xbm image.  This should be
    completely fixed in 3.11.
  New defaults: grelb substituted for life icon, -install for
    installation of the colormap, some modes slowed down so they would look
    correct on fast machines.

3.9
  All modes (except eyes.c) have been updated to use less global variables.
    Also updated xlockmore to ANSI C by GNU's protoize.
  demon.c updated to be faster.  Although it is now significantly more
    complicated.
  ant.c and demon now have runtime options.   -neighbors 6 or 4 (default = 4)
    -gridsize (170 default)  (In ant, when neighbors = 6 it is called bees.
    Not much is known about these critters.  They do not seem to exhibit the
    highway building activity found in normal ants, but otherwise they
    behave pretty similar.)
  flag mode thanks to Charles Vidal <vidalc@club-internet.fr>.
  The Lissajous worm (lissie mode) thanks to Alexander Jolk
    <ub9x@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>.
  Shape mode now has triangles.  Also now looks better when minimized.
    From an idea in REC (Recreational & Educational Computing).
  Random mode now tells you which mode is running when run with -verbose
    [formerly -v].
    Added VERBOSE stuff to life, life3d, life1d, and ant.
  Changed rock.c to use blue by default for the left eye.  All 3D glasses
    I have seen use blue.
  Fixed swirl so it would not swirl "white".  Even if it is not a bg or fg
    color.  This made the border around the little window change color.
  From Ron Hitchens <ron@idiom.com>:
    patch for middle button so that it will change locks even if duration
      is 0 in random mode.
    patch for window title noticeable when used with the -inwindow option.
    fixed up demon.c
  Random access to raster files by giving a directory thanks to Jouk
    Jansen <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.  If UNIX, give directory followed by
    a "/", also it may try to put "." as an image file.
  When xlock is compiled with shadow passwords it will still work on non
    shadowed systems that use elf, thanks to Marek Michalkiewicz
    <marekm@i17linuxb.ists.pwr.wroc.pl>  Compilation with HAS_SHADOW is
    forced on Linux with ELF (even if shadow passwording is not used).
    This will facilitate a migration towards shadow passwording.
  For the sake of completeness, xbm files can now be read in at run-time.
    Courtesy of John Bradley's xv(xvbm.c), used by permission.
  "xlock -nolock -lockdelay 1" should no longer crash

3.8
  system call for sounds using DEF_PLAY thanks to Milco Numan
    <milcon@krim.chem.uva.nl>
  Used GNU's indent to reformat all *.c and *.h files.  It may have
    screwed up some comments. I used:
    -bap -nbacc -bad -nbc -br -bs -c33 -cd33 -ncdb -ce
    -d0 -di12 -neei -fc1 -i8 -ip8 -l79 -lp -npcs -psl -nsc -nsob
    -cli8 -cs -cp1
  Multiple root accounts for allowroot.  Thanks to Lewis Muhlenkamp
    <lewism@tt.comm.mot.com>.
  Better make.com file for for VMS thanks to Jouk Jansen and the
    author of XVMSUTILS, Trevor Taylor <taylort@decus.com.au>.
  -display fix for VAX thanks to Jouk Jansen.
  eyes mode, revamp to eliminate need for global variables in modes,
    new hooks (release and refresh), and middle button for "Next" in
    random mode, thanks to Ron Hitchens <ron@idiom.com>.
    This now allows for many things to be cleaned up.  Due to the number
    of modes, it will take a few releases.  See HACKERS.GUIDE.
  puzzle mode thanks to Heath Rice <hrice@netcom.com> & Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.
  Raster files (for puzzle.c and image.c) thanks to Tobias Gloth
    <gloth@math.uni-muenster.de> & Jouk Jansen <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.
    Background is now black when used with -install.
  swirl for 16 bytes per pixel patch <davidm@azstarnet.com>
  bouboule mode memory leaks fixed thanks to Jeremie Petit <jpetit@essi.fr>.
  maze's dead ends are now filled in.
  More syslog stuff for notifying failures in unlocking xlock Andrew Sammut
    <sammut@dstc.qut.edu.au>.
  blank now uses the power-down sleep mode if available, thanks to Ron
    Hitchens <ron@idiom.com>.

3.7
  HP bug timing bug fixed thanks to Ron Hitchens <ron@idiom.com>.
  3D mode for rock thanks to <theiling@coli.uni-sb.de>.
    Get out your 3D glasses, Red on right and Green on left.
  added compile time option for spline, FOLLOW to erase old splines
    like Qix thanks to Richard Duran <rduran@cs.utep.edu>
  petal now works with -inroot .
  CDE DT saver thanks to Trevor Bourget <trevor@thomsoft.com>
    see Imakefile and README.
  bouboule mode added, thanks to Jeremie Petit <jpetit@essi.fr>.
    bouboule fixed for VMS and TrueColor.

3.6
  Many patches, thanks to Ron Hitchens <ron@idiom.com>.
    xlock now appears over the screensaver, passwd.c reorganized,
    new event loop in xlock.c, new icons in bitmaps, updated clock
    and triangle, and resource parsing fixed for "xlock".
  pedal renamed to petal.
  Clock mode updated to change in size thanks to original author
    Petit Jeremie <jpetit@essi.fr>.
  More context handling stuff for DCE thanks to Terje Marthinussen
    <terjem@cc.uit.no>.
  slip mode added thanks to Scott Draves <spot@cs.cmu.edu>
    with a patch from <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.
  patch for -messagesfile code favored early quotes and new event loop
    compatibility thanks to <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.
  XLock.ad and xlock.man updated to be more consistent.
  ultrix fix for strdup thanks to Erik Bertelsen <erik@sockdev.uni-c.dk>.
  invalid sound added thanks to <J.M.Box@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>
  Thanks to <mccomb@interport.net> for helping to debug marquee and nose
    on multiheaded machines.

3.5
  Fixed my goof on worm.c.
  vms_play fixed for nonexisting sound files and -messagesfile code
    updated thanks to <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.
  marquee now more random and memmove no longer used.
  marquee fixed for multiheaded machines thanks to Caleb Epstein
    <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Random number generator fixed for 64 bit "long" thanks to Scott McCoy
    <smccoy@dr3w.ess.harris.com>.

3.4
  rplay patch thanks to Simon Banks <sbanks@cellnet.co.uk>.  xlock now
    has sound where available.  Edit your favorite makefile.
  2 new modes thanks to Tobias Gloth <gloth@math.uni-muenster.de>.
    marquee (I changed a lot) shows text on the screen, similar to nose
    triangle, (colormaping removed) similar to mountain
  nose text functions removed to utils.c
  image.c now with -imagefile option (only with XPM).
  rect.c name changed to shape.c.
  swirl.c and world.c fixed for multiscreens, thanks to Grant McDorman
    <grant@isgtec.com>.
  A better way of handling fortunes from a file, thanks to Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.  To try use -messagesfile fortune.dat.
    Also contributed vms_play.c and a new make.com file.
  KERBEROS patch thanks to Omar Siddique <omar@gl.umbc.edu> for sending
    and testing it (patch author unknown).

3.3
  LIFE_5655 and LIFE_6767 compile time options for life3d.
  ultrix passwd bug fix thanks to Erik Bertelsen <erik@sockdev.uni-c.dk>.
  nose now has a font option and is fixed for multiscreens.
  Stupid memory leak in ant fixed.  Now random colors.
  swirl now needs to be used with -install to look right,
    thanks to Heath A. Kehoe <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu>.
  Patch for AIX thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl>.
  Color pixmaps for bat from <patol@info.isbiel.ch>.
  image pixmaps now default to bitmaps if xpm fails, thanks to
    <Markus.Zellner@anu.edu.au>.
  flame crashed xlock when using random mode on Linux, fixed.
  Numerous fixes for multiscreens incl: bat, bounce, rect, hyper, life1d,
    forest, laser, mountain, and braid.  Also xlock.c patched or second
    screen would have a black and white display.
    Purify found memory leaks in swirl, mountain, laser, hyper, maze.
    Thanks to <mccomb@interport.net>.
  New option -lockdelay #, for those who were bothered by xautolock
    locking the screen when you you did not want it, now just hit
    return (within a specified number of seconds) to get the screen back.
    This option is intended to be used with xautolock.
  worm now has no limit on the number of worms.
  pyro bug fixed for large batchcount (500-2000), thanks to
    Minoura Makoto <minoura@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>.

3.2
  Doug McLaren <dougmc@comco.com> noticed a big security hole in
    nose.c when xlock is setuid to root.  Now, after the password is
    read, it gives up root, thanks to Heath A. Kehoe
    <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu>.
  DCE Authentication patch added.
  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@hrem.stm.tudelft.nl> for clearing up
    a timing problem using -DOLD_EVENT_LOOP .

3.1
  Multipatch by Heath A. Kehoe <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu> it includes
    speed up in helix, random mode now switches modes, input to mode
    is now customizable (see random.c), and a DCE authentication patch
    (based on work by Phil O'Connell <philo@icaen.uiowa.edu>).  Also
    usleep was dropped in favor of a new timing mechanism.  It is still
    available using -DOLD_EVENT_LOOP (VMS still uses it by default).
  braid.c thanks to John Neil <neil@math.idbsu.edu>.
  helix now looks even better.  I found a bug in the translation from
    xscreensaver.
  nose.c may still need a little work (its a bit slow).  Taken from 2
    sources xnlock and xscreensaver's noseguy.  It no longer leaves
    dust on the screen as well (the bitmaps are shifted up by one pixel).
  pedal.c taken from xscreensaver.
  Patches for OSF1_ENH_SEC but it unfortunately seems to need more work.
  Idea to have the mode.h defaults used thanks to Roland Bock
    <exp120@physik.uni-kiel.d400.de>.
  closedown patch for xdm use from Janet Carson's xclosedown
    with modifications from Anthony Thyssen <anthony@cit.gu.edu.au>.
  image.c updated to use xbm if using a monochrome monitor or using -mono.
  life1d, bug.c, ant.c, and demon.c added from Scientific American's
    Computer Recreations.
  hop.c now has Peter de Jong's hop.  Half the time its boring but
    the other half of the time its great.
  A better patch from Peter Schmitzberger <schmitz@coma.sbg.ac.at> for
    spiral (a bug that I introduced).

3.0
  Patch from Peter Schmitzberger <schmitz@coma.sbg.ac.at> for maze and image.
  Thanks to Shane Watts <shane@phobes.mlckew.edu.au> for helping me with
    Linux shadowing.
  world.c backward spinning jump fixed by Neale Pickett <zephyr@nmt.edu>.
  laser.c bug (that I introduced) solved by Heath A. Kehoe
    <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu>.
  Edited rect so that it does ellipses as well, like After Dark.
    I should of renamed it right?
  Got rid of "+=" in Imakefile because HP, AIX, and Ultrix have
    trouble with it.  Still used by some systems where there seems to
    be no trouble.
  passwd.c extracted from xlock.c and xlock.h .  May have cured some
    bugs (like a BIG network security bug) but most likely broke some
    systems.  Thanks for the many people who gave feedback during
    the BETA test.

2.10
  xlockrc password for more user control of xlock.  Author unknown.
    It is a compile-time option, see Imakefile and README.
    Moved usleep.c and hsbramp.c to utils.c and logout.c to opt.c .
    Split out mode.h from resource.c .
  Changes of Skip_Burrell@sterling.com were incorporated into image.c .
    Not sure how to get pixmaps to randomize color and -mono does
    not work for pixmaps.  See Imakefile and README.
  -allowroot now works on Solaris2.x.
  Clock mode added, thanks to Jeremie Petit <petit@simula.unice.fr>.
  laser and mountain modes added, similar to After Dark's version, and
    also forest mode thanks to Pascal Pensa <pensa@aurora.unice.fr>.
  Updated maze and helix after seeing mountain mode.  Do not have to
    wait a second to enter password. :)
  Now provide random number generator.  Thanks to Mike Arras
    <arras@intertv.com>.  I changed RAND to LRAND.
  Due to overwhelming demand, the old flame is back... well OK its
    slightly modified.
  Patch for SUNOS_ADJUNCT_PASSWD, thanks to Dale A. Harris
    <rodmur@ecst.csuchico.edu>.
  Imakefile reorganized for AIX.

2.9
  "make install.man" should now work for imake users (if you would like
   it to work for Makefile.hp ...  mail me the patch).
  Unbundled SunC warnings removed in bitmap files, maze, grav, life,
    and swirl.
  Swirl patched to work sensibly with TrueColor displays, thanks to
    Steve Early <sde1000@cam.ac.uk>
  Rock mode made much better by Jeremie Petit <petit@simula.unice.fr>.
  Imakefile reorganized by <mjacob@feral.COM> for Solaris2.x .
  Reorganized the README and the screens are now (mostly) alphabetical
    throughout.
  Updated life3d to include compile-time options LIFE_5766 and LIFE_4555.
    5766 is more like life, but 4555 (default) seems to be better.
  I went through the lifep.zip (May 94) collection and pulled out some
    small and interesting life forms.
  I added another control to the screens.  "-cycles num" influences the
    time out (it applies to about a 1/3 of the screens, see man pages).
    For consistency, the meaning of batchcount for qix, life, life3d,
    and rect was changed.  References to "seconds()" in the screens were
    removed.  The length of a "cycle" depends on "delay".
  Multidisplay bug fix for maze, thanks to <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  AIXV3 with AFS, thanks to <chuck_hines@VNET.IBM.COM>.

2.8
  No more bomb.c, if you think xlock needs it, let the maintainer know.
  full_lock rewritten by Dale A. Harris <rodmur@ecst.csuchico.edu> to
    handle non-login groups as well.
  fixed a bug in wator, introduced in 2.7.
  fixed nanosleep bug for delays of 1 second or more.  Nanosleep is now
    used by default on Solaris.  The Imakefile will have to be modified
    if using Solaris 2.0-2.2, since nanosleep is not available.
  I do not know why, but the logout out feature now works on Solaris.
  Various warnings and errors fixed in make.com, resource.c, logout.c,
    and galaxy.c for VMS.  Also fixed random generator for VMS not to
    toggle the least significant bit.  This made worm.c look funny.
  xlock now works on VMS/AXP thanks to <JOUKJ@CRYS.CHEM.UVA.NL>.  One
    will have to uncomment sections in make.com .  Also fixed some
    AIX problems.
  Modes spiral and geometry thanks to Darrick Brown <dbrown@cs.hope.edu>.
    Batchcount in maze and spline were changed to behave similarly.
  A patch from Heath Rice <hrice@netcom.com> for a better way to handle
    batchcount, delay, and saturation.
  I went through xlife3.0 huge collection and added "suitable" lifeforms.

2.7
  sgi patches and logos from Dave Truesdell <truesdel@nas.nasa.gov>.
  flame bug fixed thanks to <spot@cs.cmu.edu> and
    <M.R.Dobie@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
  MANY patches from Heath A. Kehoe <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu> include:
    The long awaited HP patch.  It appears there was a bug in HP's XFlush
    function.  So XSync was substituted.  HP_PASSWDETC patch.
    maze, swarm, and worm -mono now look better.
    Many changes to the Imakefile, new compile time features ...
    including a logout button for labs (this appears to be better
    implementation than the bomb mode (much of the bomb code has been
    reused)) -install option to allow xlock to install its own colormap
    if it runs out of colors.
  Thanks to <slouken@virtbrew.water.ca.gov> for yet another option:
    grabmouse for compatibility with xscreensaver.  So you would set
    your apps-defaults file for xscreensaver like:

*programs:      xlock -nolock +grabmouse -mode random

  Updated life3d to include shooting gliders.
  BSD and Linux icons slightly modified.  Also new ships for life.
  Compile time options HAS_RAND, HAS_RANDOM, and HAS_RAND48, and
    updated the sccsid so `what` will give you something meaningful.

2.6
  Created a HAS_USLEEP and a USE_VROOT switch.
    There were numerous reports of the incompatibility with tvtwm,
    (also problems with windows with StickyAbove set to true and
    swirl), read the README section on that.
  Thanks to Chris Ross <cross@va.pubnix.com>, maintainer of tvtwm, for
    fixing various bugs; make depend for R5 and less, life3d should not
    have malloc.h, and a time-elapsed patch.
  A few new life forms for life.c.  Anyone know what SMILEY is really
    supposed to look like?  :)
  Revised -inroot does not lock screen, as this is done better with the
    following patch, and as someone pointed out, its not intuitive.
  Thanks to Tim Medley for sending the -geometry patch of Mike Peercy
    <peercy@crhc.uiuc.edu>.  Many of the modes will fail if the windows
    are far from square or are too small.  You can place Xlock off the
    screen, for example,
      xlock -enablesaver -mode blank -geometry +1152+0
    puts the window off the visible screen on a Sun.
  A new version of flame.c from the original author Scott Draves
    <spot@cs.cmu.edu>.
  Something really devilish for BSD (new icons) thanks to J Wunsch
    <j@uriah.sax.de>, but they have been modified.  I also created a
    Linux icon.
  A patch for Ultrix systems (at least DECstations) running enhanced
    security thanks to Chris Fuhrman <cfuhrman@vt.edu> and friend.
  Multidisplay bug fix for life3d and wator, thanks to
    <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Life3d on a monochrome monitor looks a little better. -mono was
    working right.

2.5
  A patch for swirl for fixed color maps (more colorful) and the
    image now spirals outwards from the center with a fixed number of
    points drawn every iteration, thanks to <M.R.Dobie@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
  A patch for blot on dual-headed machines and nanosleep, thanks to
    Greg Onufer <Greg.Onufer@Eng.Sun.COM>. Use nanosleep on Solaris2.3
    and greater, examine the Imakefile and/or README for details.
  A long needed patch for X11R5+ for -delay, -batchcount, and
    -saturation to work thanks to Patrick D Sullivan <pds@bss.com>.
  bomb mode patch for more flexibility thanks to Dave Shield
    <D.T.Shield@csc.liv.ac.uk>.
  bomb mode patch for Sun10 thanks to Nicolas Pioch <pioch@Email.ENST.Fr>.
  modes wator and life3d added.
  life now has a random soup pattern stolen from life3d.
  -inroot option added, thanks to Bill Woodward <wpwood@pencom.com>.
    Now more compatible with xscreensaver if run as
    "xlock -mode kaleid -inroot -nolock".

2.4
  hopalong now includes a sine hop (but less likely to come up).
  life now has new organisms. They are now better centered.  Some of
   the nonperiodic forms were removed.
   life's gliders now come from the edge of the screen, usually.
  image now centers icons, for example, the hp icon is now centered.
  blot now randomly has xsym, ysym, or both.
  Solaris should now compile out of the box to handle shadow passwords.
    Thanks to Alain Brossard <brossard@siisun.epfl.ch>.
  rock, grav, rect, bat, world, bounce and swirl fix for 24 bit colors.
  Patch for building under HP-UX with Secured Passwords, thanks to
    Dale Harris <rodmur@ecst.csuchico.edu>.

2.3
  Now the X Logo displays if not Sun or HP.
  "bat" mode disastrous bug fixed.  Thanks to R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk
    for pointing it out.
  -DMOUSE_MOTION switch added for those who want the Password window to
    come up if you just moved the mouse. (Not recommended).
  "swirl" mode was modified to check background, foreground, and black
    so as not to cycle these colors, special thanks to Mark Dobie
    <mrd@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
  -DFORCEFIXEDCOLORS switch for those who are annoyed by swirl cycling
    its colors.

2.2
  Made more consistent with the slackware release.  XLock.ad changes
    to rock, rotor, and foreground and background colors.
  Fixed bug in life.c, evident in the Slackware release.
  Minor patch for swirl on HP's due to R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk.
  "bat" put back with minor changes.

2.1
  Large modifications to README.
  Patch for building under QNX 4.2 w/ Metrolink X server, thanks to
    Brian Campbell <brianc@qnx.com>.

2.0
  "swirl" mode was added, thanks to Mark Dobie <mrd@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
    WOW, but not-so-neat on monochrome monitors.
  Patch for Solaris 2.3 for local, NIS, and NIS+ passwords, thanks to
    <Christian.Iseli@di.epfl.ch>.
  "image" mode was put back but random will not run it, too boring.
  "bomb" mode was added, thanks to <D.T.Shield@compsci.liverpool.ac.uk>.
  In order to use extra-long passwords with the Linux, changed
    PASSLENGTH from 20 to 64.  Thanks to <slouken@virtbrew.water.ca.gov>.

1.14
  Multidisplay bug fix for rect, thanks to <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Now works on IRIX on the SGI. Thanks to <reggers@julian.uwo.ca>.
  Now works on NetBSD. Thanks to Greg Earle <earle@isolar.Tujunga.CA.US>.
  Now works on a Alpha 3000/400 OSF/1 V2.0. Thanks to Udo Linauer
    <ul@eacpc4.tuwien.ac.at>.
  "galaxy" mode was added, thanks to Hubert Feyrer
    <hubert.feyrer@rz.uni-regensburg.de>.
  "kaleid" mode was added, taken from the Linux version of xkaleid.

1.13
  "timeelapsed" option was added.  Allows you to find out how long a
    machine is locked so you can complain to an administrator.
  Now may work on IRIX on the SGI. Thanks to Thomas Runge
    <runge@egd.igd.fhg.de>
  "bat" mode was added, thanks to Lorenzo Patocchi <patol@info.isbiel.ch>.

1.12
  xlock now works on Linux with shadow passwords.  Special thanks to
    H. J. Dihu <macgyver@mcs.com>

1.11
  Shadow passwords and DES encryption are now detected by the Imakefile.
    Victor Langeveld <vic@mbfys.kun.nl> reorganized the Imakefile for
    shadow passwords and crypt.  Now should compile "right out of the
    box" (although there are still problems on Solaris 2.3).
  Patch to fix sudden rotation changes in rock from Yoshiaki Kasahara
    <kasahara@csce.kyushu-u.ac.jp>.

1.10
  R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk reorganized the Imakefile yet again.
  Fixed a bug in rect.c thanks to <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Ditched bzero and bcopy since both are more generally available as
    memset and memcpy.  Also removed some lint warnings.

1.9
  "rect" mode was added from xscreensaver's greynetic.
  "helix" bug fixed.  It is now more interesting.
  bounce.c divide by zero fixed and grav.c improvements.  Thanks to Greg
    Bowering <greg@cs.adelaide.edu.au>.
  grav.c, rock.c, world.c fixed so no black objects.

1.8
  Imakefile did not work with R6.  Also Solaris2.3 may use SVR4
    instead of SYSV.  Thanks to Chris P. Ross <cross@eng.umd.edu>
  "grav" mode was added.  Its a simplistic gravitational simulation,
    with (currently a constant 16) solid spheres (non-rendered) of equal
    size and mass orbiting a fixed central mass.  The sphere's orbit in
    3 dimensions, their position and size being projected with simple
    perspective.  Thanks to Greg Bowering <greg@cs.adelaide.edu.au>.
  "inwindow" option was added.  Allows you to do what xlock already
    did when DEBUG was defined.  It no longer locks your screen, but
    allows you to run xlock as a (somewhat distracting) decoration.
    Thanks to Greg Bowering <greg@cs.adelaide.edu.au>.
  "bounce" mode (football) is back.
  "world" mode was added.  Thanks to Matthew Moyle-Croft
    <mmc@cs.adelaide.edu.au>
  "image" mode was removed. It was very similar to world anyway.

1.7
  cuserid() is needed by Solaris2.3 with shadow passwords in xlock.c.
    Thanks to Bill <benedett@gentire.com>.

1.6
  R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk pointed out again that gray_bits in maze.c needs
    a type cast.
  xlock.c defaults to "blank" to minimize cpu usage on a network.

1.5
  xlock works again on VMS (see README.VMS) thanks to Anthony Clarke
    <Anthony.D.Clarke@Support.Hatfield.Raytheon.bae.eurokom.ie>.
  memcpy and memset definitions for SYSV. Also there now is a switch
    for shadow passwords thanks to <reggers@julian.uwo.ca>.

1.4
  Now works on BSD. Thanks to Victor Langeveld <vic@mbfys.kun.nl>
  Both Victor and Alexandre Miguel <miguel@natacha.ens-cachan.fr>
    suggested taking out the cuserid() call in xlock.c.  For FreeBSD its
    a necessity and the old way is is a security hole in SunOS.

1.3
  Linux port from Darren Senn's (sinster@scintilla.capitola.ca.us) xlock.
  Fixed drand to random in helix.c
  Fixed a memory leak in rock.c.

1.2
  SHIFT - CONTROL - BREAK on the HP is trapped. Thanks to
  R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk who pointed out that this was done in xscreensaver.
  AIXV3 and HP bugs fixed, again due to R. K. Lloyd.

1.1 & 1.0
  took out "rint" from "worm.c" since HP's have trouble with it
  added spline, maze, sphere, hyper, helix, rock, & blot modes.
  fixed "xlock.h" and "usleep" for the HP.
  changed border so it varies with size of screen on "swarm" so the
    wasp would not be stuck in a corner when the password is entered.
