xlock locks the X server till the user enters their password
at  the  keyboard.   While  xlock is running, all new server
connections are refused.  The screen saver is disabled.  The
mouse  cursor  is  turned  off.  The screen is blanked and a
changing pattern is put on the screen.  If a key or a  mouse
button is pressed then the user is prompted for the password
of the user who started xlock.

2 If the  correct  password  is  typed,  then  the  screen  is
unlocked  and  the  X  server  is restored.  When typing the
password Control-U and Control-H  are  active  as  kill  and
erase  respectively.   To return to the locked screen, click
in the small icon version of the changing pattern.

2 In  the  lower  part  of  the  password  screen  a  text  is
displayed.  This message is taken from the first file of the
following that exists:   $HOME/.xlocktext,  $HOME/.plan,  or
$HOME/.signature.

2 On systems which support new BSD style  authentication,  the
password may be prefixed by an authentication style followed
by a colon (i.e. "style:password").  See  the  login.conf(5)
for more information on authentication styles.

2 NOTE_ON ETIQUETTE
2 Xlock should not be used on public terminals when there is a
high demand for them.

2 If you find a  public  terminal  that  has  been  locked  by
another user and there are no other terminals available, and
the terminal appears to have been  left  idle  for  a  while
(normally  more than 15 minutes), it is fair to try to reset
the session in some manner.

2 OPTIONS
-help
     Print options and a brief description to standard  out-
     put.

        bomb).

-delay usecs
     The delay option sets the speed at which  a  mode  will
     operate.   It simply sets the number of microseconds to
     delay between batches of animations.  In blank mode, it
     is  important  to  set  this  to  some  small number of
     seconds,  because  the  keyboard  and  mouse  are  only
     checked  after  each delay, so you cannot set the delay
     too high, but a delay of zero would needlessly  consume
     cpu  checking  for  mouse and keyboard input in a tight
     loop, since blank mode has no work to do.

     whichever is less).

-batchcount num
     The batchcount option is depreciated but  should  still
     work as count.

-cycles num
     The cycles option sets the number of cycles until  time
     out  for  ant, blot, braid, bug, clock, crystal, daisy,
     deco, demon, dilemma,  discrete,  dragon,  eyes,  flag,

-size num

     The size option sets the size maximum size of a star in
     bouboule,  pyro  and  star,  size  of  ball in ball and
     bounce, size of bat in bat, maximum size of  bubble  in

     dilemma, dragon, life, life1d, pacman, tetris,  voters,
     wator,  and wire.  In pipes it is the maximum length of
     a system.  In atlantis it is the shark size.   A  nega-
     tive number allows for randomness, similar to count. In
     fire, gears, sballs and sproingies it is  the  size  of
     the  screen,  this  is  because on many slow systems it
     runs too slow when the picture covers the full screen.

-ncolors num
     The ncolors option sets the maximum number of colors to
     be used.

-saturation value
     The saturation option sets saturation of the color ramp
     used  to  value  .  0  is  grayscale and 1 is very rich
     color.  0.4 is a nice pastel.

-erasemode modename
     As of this writing there are over 9  erase  modes  sup-
     ported  (if  its  not  chosen its assumed random).  The
     erase modes are random_lines, random_squares, venetian,
     triple_wipe, quad_wipe, circle_wipe, three_circle_wipe,
     squaretate, no_fade.

-erasedelay usecs
     The erasedelay option sets the number  of  microseconds
     for  steps  of  the  erasemode  (a setting of 0 and the
     erasemode is bypassed).

+/-nolock
     The nolock option causes xlock to only  draw  the  pat-
     terns and not lock the display.  A key press or a mouse
     click will terminate the screen saver.

-/+inwindow
     Runs xlock in a window, so that you can iconify,  move,
     or resize it and still use your screen for other stuff.
     When running in a window, xlock no  longer  locks  your
     screen, it just looks good.

-/+inroot
     Runs xlock in your  root  window.   Like  the  inwindow
     option  it  no  longer  locks the screen, it just looks
     good.

-/+remote
     The remote option tells xlock  to  not  stop  you  from
     locking remote X11 servers.  This option should be used
     with care and is intended mainly to lock X11  terminals
     which  cannot  run  xlock locally.  If you lock someone
     else's workstation, they will have to know  your  pass-
     word   to  unlock  it.   Using  +remote  overrides  any
     resource derived values for remote and  prevents  xlock
     from  being  used  to lock other X11 servers.  (Use `+'
     instead of `-' to override resources for other  options
     that can take the `+' modifier similarly.)

-/+mono
     The mono option causes  xlock  to  display  monochrome,
     (black  and  white)  pixels  rather  than  the  default
     colored ones on color displays.

-/+allowaccess
     This option is required for servers which do not  allow
     clients  to modify the host access control list.  It is
     also useful if you need to run x clients  on  a  server
     which is locked for some reason...  When allowaccess is
     true, the X11 server is left open for clients to attach
     and  thus  lowers  the  inherent  security of this lock
     screen.  A side effect of using this option is that  if
     xlock  is  killed -KILL, the access control list is not
     lost.

-vtlock modename
     This option is used on a XFree86 system  to  manage  VT
     switching in [off|noswitch|switch|restore] mode.

off       means no VT switch locking.

switch    means VT switch locking + switching  to  xlock  VT
          when activated.

restore   means VT switch locking + switching  to  xlock  VT
          when  activated  +  switching  back to previous VT
          when desactivated.

noswitch  means VT switch locking  only  when  xlock  VT  is
          active.

-/+allowroot
     The allowroot option allows the root password to unlock
     the  server as well as the user who started xlock.  May

     not be able to turn this on and off depending  on  your
     system and how xlock was configured.

-/+debug
     Allows xlock to be debugged by doing  all  but  locking
     the screen.

-/+description
     The  description  option  causes  xlock  shows  a  mode
     description  above  password window.  The default is to
     show this description.

-/+echokeys
     The echokeys option causes xlock to echo '?' characters
     for each key typed into the password prompt.  Some con-
     sider this a security risk, so the default  is  to  not
     echo anything.

-/+enablesaver
     By default xlock will disable  the  normal  X  server's
     screen  saver  since  it is in effect a replacement for
     it.  Since it is possible to set delay parameters  long
     enough  to  cause  phosphor burn on some displays, this
     option will turn back on the default screen saver which
     is very careful to keep most of the screen black.

-/+resetsaver
     By default xlock will call XResetScreenSaver.  This may
     be undesirable with DPMS monitors.

-/+grabmouse
     The grabmouse option causes xlock to grab the mouse and
     keyboard,  this is the default.  xlock can not lock the
     screen without this.

-/+grabserver
     The grabserver option causes xlock to grab the  server.
     This  is not usually needed but some unsecure X servers
     can be defeated without this.

-/+install
     Allows xlock to install its own colormap if xlock  runs
     out  of  colors.   May  not  work  on  with some window
     managers (fvwm) and does  not  work  with  the  -inroot
     option.

-/+mousemotion
     Allows you to turn on and off the  sensitivity  to  the
     mouse to bring up the password window.

-/+sound
     Allows you to turn on and off sound if  installed  with

     the capability.

-/+timeelapsed
     Allows you to find out how long a machine is locked  so
     you  can  complain  to an administrator that someone is
     hogging a machine.

-/+usefirst
     The usefirst option causes xlock to use  the  keystroke
     which got you to the password screen as the first char-
     acter in the password.  The default is  to  ignore  the
     first key pressed.

-/+verbose
     Verbose mode, tells what options it is going to use.

-nice nicelevel
     The nice option sets system nicelevel of the xlock pro-
     cess to nicelevel .

     word screen to color .

-bg color
     The bg option sets the color of the background  on  the
     password screen to color .

-foreground color
     The foreground option sets the color of the text on the
     password screen to color .

-background color
     The background option sets the color of the  background
     on the password screen to color .

-username string
     Text string is shown in front of user name, defaults to
     "Name: ".

-password string
     Text string is the password prompt string, defaults  to
     "Password: ".

-info string
     Text string is an informational  message  to  tell  the
     user what to do, defaults to "Enter password to unlock;
     select icon to lock.".

-validate string
     Text string is a message  shown  while  validating  the
     password, defaults to "Validating login..."

-invalid string
     Text  string  is  a  message  shown  when  password  is
     invalid, defaults to "Invalid login."

-geometry geom
     The geometry option sets geom the size  and  offset  of
     the  lock  window  (normally  the  entire screen).  The
     entire screen format is still  used  for  entering  the
     password.  The purpose is to see the screen even though
     it is locked.  This should be used with  caution  since
     many of the modes will fail if the windows are far from
     square or are too small  (size  must  be  greater  than
     0x0).   This  should  also be used with -enablesaver to
     protect screen from phosphor burn.

-icongeometry geom
     The icongeometry option  sets  geom  the  size  of  the
     iconic  screen  (normally 64x64) seen when entering the
     password.  This should be used with caution since  many
     of  the  modes  will  fail  if the windows are far from
     square or are too small  (size  must  be  greater  than
     0x0).   The  greatest size is 256x256.  There should be
     some limit so  users  could  see  who  has  locked  the
     screen.  Position information of icon is ignored.

-glgeometry geom
     The glgeometry option sets geom the size of the  screen
     for gl modes.  Not normally available or needed.

     fortune generator.  Currently used only for marquee and
     nose modes.

-messagesfile formatted-filename
     The messagesfile option sets the file to be used as the
     fortune  generator.   The  first entry is the number of
     fortunes, the next line  contains  the  first  fortune.

     if  compiled  in).  "all,blank"  will  get  all  modes.
     "all,-image bounce,+blank" will get all modes but image
     and bounce.  "bug wator" will get only bug  and  wator.
     "allgl"  will  get  only  the  GL modes if compiled in,
     all-allgl will get all but the GL modes, "allnice" will
     weed  out  high cpu usage modes (as well as hackers and
     gl modes).  "allxpm" will get all modes that  use  xpm.
     "allwrite"  will  get  all modes that take advantage of
     writable colormaps (not including xpm).   "all3d"  will
     get all the modes that support this option.  "allmouse"
     will get all the modes that support mouse  interaction.
     Similarly,  "allautomata" for automata modes, "allfrac-
     tal" for  fractal  modes,  "allgeometry"  for  geometry
     modes,  "allspace"  for  space  modes.  The random mode

     itself can not be referenced.

-/+sequential
     Turn on non-random random option.

**WARNING**
xlock can appear to hang if it is  competing  with  a  high-
priority  process  for  the  CPU.  For  example, if xlock is
started after a process with  'nice  -20'  (high  priority),
xlock will take  considerable amount of time to respond.

2 SHADOW_PASSWORDS
2 If the machine is using a shadow password system, then xlock
may  not  be  set up to get the real password and so must be
given one of its own. This can  be  either  on  the  command
line,   via   the   -cpasswd   option,   or   in   the  file
$HOME/.xlockrc, with the first taking precedence.   In  both
cases  an  encrypted  password is expected (see makekey(8)).
2 If neither is given, then xlock will prompt for  a  password
and  will  use that, also storing an encrypted version of it
in $HOME/.xlockrc for future use.

2 BUGS
"kill -KILL xlock " causes the server that was locked to  be
unusable, since all hosts (including localhost) were removed
from the access control list to lock out new X clients,  and
since  xlock  could  not catch SIGKILL, it terminated before
restoring the access control list.  This will  leave  the  X
server  in  a state where "you can no longer connect to that
server, and this operation cannot  be  reversed  unless  you
reset  the server."            -From the X11R4 Xlib Documen-
tation, Chapter 7.
2 NCD terminals do not allow xlock to  remove  all  the  hosts
from  the  access  control list.  Therefore you will need to
use the "-remote" and "-allowaccess" switches.  If you  hap-
pen  to run without "-allowaccess" on an NCD terminal, xlock
will not work and you will need to reboot the  terminal,  or
simply  go into the SETUP menus, under 'Network Parameters',
and turn off TCP/IP access control.
