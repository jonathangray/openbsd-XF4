General problems:

  o It would be nice to have an option -idletime time.  Where xlock would
   run after a certain idle time.  (Here xautolock may help you, see
   above).

  o xscreensaver compatibility
    2 of the writable modes: mandelbrot, tube-> get them to RUN (compile OK)
    XPM  capability needs to be improved.

  o Add a way to get xlock to switch to "blank" mode after X minutes
    of (keyboard) inactivity, and to switch back to whatever mode list was
    being used when activity is detected.  This would be good for
    users using DPMS to power down the monitor without using precious cpu
    when the modes are not visible.

  o configure.in should be condensed.  Its getting out of hand.

  o Look into any way of not clearing the screen if can not get control of it
     (2nd xlock running).

  o gentlerandom mode option.  Switching to next mode when mode completed
      what it was working on.

  o On a PsuedoColor display
      xlock -mode life -install &
      sleep 5 ; xlock -mode life -install
    Colors will all be messed up after the second one tries to run.
    This can easily happen if you are using xautolock and decide to lock
    the display manually.

  o -wireframe should be a mode option (i.e. you should be able to turn it
    on and off for a particular mode).  Also a linewidth mode option would be
    nice

  o I got an error with moebius running it on opengl on a 24 bit TrueColor like:
    xlock -mode moebius -visual PseudoColor
    (all the gl modes are messed up anyway... all mono)

  o some configurations of linux: swarm has noise when bees go beyond screen
    Sun Ultra5 PCI Bus 24 bit display: flow has some noise (usually red)

  o A few uninitialized memory reads and memory leaks were detected in some
   of the code.  grep for "PURIFY" in the source files to see where the
   remaining problems are.  Also see docs/Purify for more details.

  o -mono does not work for XPM, especially cartoon (others use XBM when
   mono), also cage and stairs.

  o Not all resources are listed in "xlock -resources", e.g. nolock.
   If xlock is renamed these resources are not picked up.

  o Without any programs stealing your colors, like netscape
   xlock -modelist all -sequential -install -verbose
   Hit the middle button a hundred times (not to bad on an ultra actually)
   or try -duration 1 and let it sit for a while.
   The second time it runs the GL modes they have all lost some colors.
   This was only noticed on Solaris with pseudocolor.  Also noticed on an
   ancient HP9000/380 HPUX9.0 with 6 bit depth (without netscape).

  o On a German keyboard and Linux if the password contains special
   characters (`|' vertical bar, `@' at-sign) while in debug mode
   everything works fine. This probably has something to do with the
   X11-keymapping, as these characters are composed with the right Alt-key
   on a German keyboard.

  o OpenGL and DT may be incompatible on PseudoColor.  (MesaGL should be
   OK.)  OpenGL frequently causes xlock to error out on non-default visuals.

  o -visual DirectColor if used with any of the with the writable modes
   (mandelbrot, swirl, or tube) may corrupt the dynamic allocation of memory.

  o Errors in modes, if any, should not break lock.

  o Compile-time option to allow running of separate processes.

  o make -n install prefix=/foo/bar does not work.

  o "xlock -mode random -modelist image -bitmap ./bitmaps/"
   It should change images when middle mouse is pushed or when
   -duration time runs out.

  o some sort of completion is used which may be confusing on UNIX
   Say if a ../bitmaps directory exists and ../bitmap does not
   xlock -mode random -modelist image -bitmap ../bitmap
   will try to load ../bitmaps as a file...

  o kill -HUP to change modes as well as middle mouse button.  Needed when
   using -inroot .

  o jpeg/gif/animated gif support  Fix ras for > 8 bit TrueColor

  o "-visual" commandline argument should accept "best" as well as
   PseudoColor, TrueColor, default, etc.

  o Is there any chance the "visual" selection code could be made
   mode-dependent?  Most Xservers that support TrueColor, etc, visuals also
   support PseudoColor visuals and it would be nice to have color-cycling
   modes like "starfish" and "swirl" pick a PseudoColor visual if available,
   while modes like "cartoon" could prevent colormap flashing by picking a
   TrueColor visual.
   I heard that VisualDepthMask taken out of vis.c it seems to work better
   to get a PseudoColor visual one a root window of 24 bits.

  o modes from xscreensaver :) : bubbles, moire, LMorph, halo, ImsMap, BlitSpin


Mode specific problems:
----------------------
  Various modes need better refresh capability.
  Various modes need more mouse capability like pacman and worm.

  ant:
    round ants.  This would involve masking and images to do efficiently.
    3d version? may be hard to see interior though.

  ball: can it be updated to use a pixmap instead of a slow circle fill?

  braid: should be made so that it can be interrupted quicker.

  bouboule: always starts at the bottom right

  bounce:
    sometimes a ball does not roll off another ball.
    momentum seems to be created.
    A -wall option, multiscreens should have balls bouncing between
      screens.
    -mode bounce -inroot may give BadWindow in X_GetWindowAttributes
      if run for a while, but the screen is not locked :)
    allow a background picture to be seen behind the bouncing football
      (soccer ball) in "bounce" mode.  Thus a picture of your favorite
      team, etc. can be seen behind the bouncing balls.
    football version of "bounce" using a pigskin instead of a soccer ball for
      Americans/Canadians/etc.
    Different balls with different mass and size.

  bug:
    3d version?

  dclock: needs a -led [LED] option

  ico:
    should have all the features of the original.
    triangular face objects do not look good when rotated.

  image: middle button should do something when called like
     "-bitmap ./bitmap/"

  flag:
    sometimes a refresh causes a white background rectangle

  hop: center and size many of the hops.

  life:
    -find option to find new lifeforms.  (mail the results out :) ).
    When the bitmap is big it is rejected.  Probably could be handled
      better but if accepted then the screen could be blank because there
      are bitmaps that are off screen.

  life3d: draws invisible cubes when it does not have to.  The original
    MS DOS code weeded this out, but it did not seem to port to X.
    Also see life.

  lyapunov: needs to be speeded up

  marquee:
    "-messagefile filename" truncates a large file.
    "-message string" does not handle Control-H correctly.
    fallback font if screen is small... like bomb


  mountain: -size # for mountain should do something.

  nose:
    should handle Control-H better for underlining and accents.
    fallback font if screen is small... like bomb

  pacman: add (varying but left/right symmetric) maze walls

  pyro: needs XDrawSegments code similar to swarm to give it depth.

  slip:
    should be less jarring
    get rid of single color blotch.
    should be made so that it can be interrupted quicker.

  star:
    fractal cracks when hit by rocks (with sound?)
    user defined ships (user defined pixmaps like eyes and pacman).
    stars should look more star-like "*"'s
    combine space and star for a backwards and sideways motion

  swirl:
    needs to be refreshed quicker
    does not refresh well when colormap changes

  text3d:
     time stuff in text3d
     maybe dclock and marquee could be combined too?
     a separate -message3d for text3d

  voters and wator:
    neighbors option bug ... sometimes circles are not
      drawn in the correct spot.
    A -/+ wrap option would be nice also.

  wire:  it needs a better circuit generator.

  xglock:  Needs a lot of work.

  kscreensaver:  port xlock to KDE.


New mode ideas... (some may be very hard :) ):
---------------------------------------------
  o "bsdworm" BSD worm game with computer (and later mouse control), also
      have more than one worm
  o "dead" a Grateful Dead mode with dancing bears/skeletons/turtles.
      (Or maybe "nose" in a tie die?)
  o "floyd" a Pink Floyd mode from the cover of "Dark Side of the Moon"
      with a turning prism and rainbow effect.
  o "graph" a random planar graph drawn ... filled in by a 5 (or 4 :) )
      coloring algorithm.
  o "mail" show that one has mail (can also be an option on flag, image, etc.)
      A spinning GL mailbox would be really cool.  Note that the password
      screen can be setup to show if one has mail.
  o "minimal" a random minimal surface generator.
  o "snow" mode with a nice Winter scene picture background and snowflakes
      falling
  o "squig" mode from squig/xsquig (xsquig is too slow)
  o A NT-like GL 3D Maze, where you are inside the maze
  o NT-like GL FlowerBox spring and Flying Objects
  o A GL 4D ico where the 6 4D "platonic" objects "roll" around in 3D space.
  o GL modes based on demos: isosurf, reflect, bounce, stex3d
  o KitCat (R) clock mode (based on X11 catclock, a version of xclock) where
     the cat clock floats around the screen like "dclock" mode does.  Colors
     of cat clock could be picked like nose-guy in "nose" mode.
  o Lottery with bouncing numbered balls like PowerBall.
  o A simple set of 2D geometric shapes that morph into one another whilst
     colour cycling. So say you start with a rectangle that morphs into a
     circle (leaving a small trail like Qix) that morphs into a triangle
     that morphs into a polygon that morphs into a rectangle, etc.  All the
     while you have movement and colour cycling like Qix.  If the trail is to
     large then things could become messy, but if too short then you loose the
     history element.
  o A simple bouncing ball on a chess board. The ball is a silver
     ray-traced/rendered globe. The chess board is a series of black and
     white squares. Each black square is gold veined marble with the gold
     glinting. Each white square is a textured surface (like little bumps, or
     ridges). The whole screen is lit from two light sources (either fixed or
     moving). As the ball bounces it reflects like a mirror what is around it.
  o A variant of the above would be to hold that ball still in the centre of
     the screen and move a randomly chosen bitmap around the ball.
  o The above could also have embossed on standout lettering added (say a
     single word like Linux). The lettering could either be stationary or
     float around the ball in orbit a bit like the the Universal studios logo
     where the Universal name revolves around a picture of the earth.
  o Take pipes and add the constantly moving view point that you get with
     rock so the mass of pipes seems to revolve and rotate around a moving
     point in space.
  o Make the little man in Nose seem to carve the letters of the message into
     rock, or paint them on the screen.
  o Make marquee use 3D extruded text that can be texture mapped and seem to
     zoom into and out of the screen with the zoom source point drifting
     around the screen at random
  o Make puzzle take the present desktop image, invert it and shuffle the
     pieces then put the whole things back. Once it has reassembled the
     desktop you could have the image flip top over bottom as it reseeds into
     the screen, only to have a new randomly shuffled version of the desktop
     flip back out.
  o Use the spheres generated in sphere to draw molecules on the screen,
     colour coding for the various types of atom present. A limit on the size
     of each sphere would be needed. The spheres could be joined by simple
     white lines. If you are feeling adventurous you could make it seem to
     rotate in space so all parts of the molecule could be seen.
  o In shape change things so that the shapes appear to be extruded from a
     random point on the screen. You could also have a number of shapes be
     extruded, each from its own origin, only to shrink back into the screen
     again.  Each time a shape shrinks back into the screen the origin would
     move and a new shape would be chosen.
  o When the screensaver is started have curtains drawn across the desktop
     at a medium pace, a second or twos pause then the curtain a pulled open
     quickly to reveal a bitmaped image in place of the desktop. This cycles
     with a different image each time.
  o In pyro have the fireworks appear to zoom from a randomly choose point on
     the screen. This would give the effect of the display being seen from
     above.

PLEASE NOTE:
-----------
  I _REALLY_ hate to turn down contributions...  I will try to consider
   all submissions.  Some things on new modes that bother me are:
   Did not black out the screen when they start.  I do not like people
     to see what I am doing. :^|  (This could be a non-default option...
     see decay mode).
   Did not work in the little window or buggy.  (I usually try to clean
     it up).
   Is too similar mode to a mode that already exists. (Maybe an option could
     be added on an existing mode?).
   Many people complained about the mode.
   Just not enough randomness or is not interesting enough.
   No multiscreen support (I usually try to clean this up too).
  But I labor over them (in a haphazard fashion) and they usually are
   released eventually.  (If they are in assembler I would definitely need
   a working example and all the binaries and libraries to get it to run.)
