Old Purify Problems (problems are now marked in code with "PURIFY")

---
Summary of unresolved memory problems with xlockmore-4.03
cartoon - Possible 29756 byte memory leak from XPutImage
swirl - Possible 256 byte memory leak from XPutImage
life - Possible 132 byte memory leak from XPutImage
There are also some uninitialized memory reads that appear to be internal
to X11.

SOLVED since xlockmore-4.08
resource.c - 1 byte memory leak (Fixed since the Purify reports)

SOLVED since xlockmore-4.02
memory leaks:               galaxy.c, life3d.c

MesaGL 2.3 fixes many cumulative leaks and uninitialized memory reads that
existed in MesaGL 2.2.  This affected all GL modes.  MesaGL 2.3 or newer is
recommended since it fixes these memory leaks and runs faster.  Cumulative
means that the memory leaks occur each time the mode is run when in random
mode, which is why after some time it may crash xlock since it runs out of
available memory.

Thanks to Tom Schmidt for the solaris and sunos purify logs.
