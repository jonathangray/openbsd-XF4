	* Imakefile: Added $(MESASRCDIR)/src/mesa/glapi to INCLUDES.
	Removed $(SERVERSRC)/mi from INCLUDES.
	Rearranged INCLUDES for better readability.
	* glwindows.h: Removed mipointrst.h and miscstruct.h from #include 
	since they are not used anymore.

	* glwindows.h: write current function and line in debug output
	* indirect.c: moved actual setup and creation of windows GL context to 
	glWinCreateContextReal. 
	* indirect.c (glWinCreateContext): Deferred context creation to attach.   
	* indirect.c (glWinMakeCurrent): Check if context is NULL. Fixes segfault.
