                                  Abstract

     This document provides information about the status of the driver
     and hardware support in XFree86 4.1.0 compared with that in XFree86
     3.3.6.  Please send updates for this document to
     <fixes@xfree86.org>.  Please do not send requests for information
     or support to that address (they will not be answered).

1.  Introduction

This document contains one section per vendor (organised alphabetically) for
each chipset family that is supported in XFree86 3.3.6 or XFree86 4.1.0.  It
includes information about the status of the drivers and the hardware they
support, including a comparison of the level of support between versions
3.3.6 and 4.1.0.  Unless otherwise stated, hardware is classified as "sup-
ported" if its driver provides basic 2D support.  Support for additional fea-
tures may or may not be present.

In XFree86 3.3.6, several X servers are available; much hardware uses the
XF86_SVGA server, which has a set of driver modules that are built into it at
compile time.  In other cases, X servers for specific chips (or families of
chips) are provided (such as XF86_AGX, XF86_Mach64, etc.).

In XFree86 4.1.0, there is only one X server, called "XFree86", which can
load driver modules at runtime.  Thus there is no specific mention of a
server binary when 4.1.0 is discussed; only the XFree86 server is used.
Third-party vendors (often the manufacturers of various video chipsets) may
provide their own drivers for the XFree86 server, but these third-party mod-
ules are beyond the scope of this document.

NOTE: Status information needs to be checked carefully and expanded where
possible.  E.g., include information about acceleration, multi-head, known
problems, hardware known to work on, platform dependencies/limitations, other
architectures known to work on (e.g., Alpha, PPC), etc.

2.  3Dfx

      3.3.6:
            Support (including acceleration) for Voodoo Banshee and Voodoo3
            cards is provided by the XF86_SVGA server with the tdfx driver.

      4.1.0:
            Support for Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo 2 chips is available on
            platforms where Glide is available (Linux and FreeBSD(?)) and is
            provided by the "glide" driver (requires version 2.x of the Glide
            library, which is not part of the XFree86 distribution).

            Support (including acceleration) for Voodoo Banshee, Voodoo3,
            Voodoo4, and Voodoo5 is provided by the "tdfx" driver.

      Summary:
            All hardware supported in 3.3.6 is also supported in 4.1.0.
