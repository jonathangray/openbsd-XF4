<abstract>

XFree86 is the Open Source port of X.Org's X11R6.4 release that supports
several UNIX(R) and UNIX-like (such as Linux, the BSDs and Solaris x86)
operating systems on Intel and other platforms.

<sect>What is XFree86 &relvers;?
<p>

<![ %updaterel [
XFree86 &relvers; is the &whichupdaterel; update to &fullrelvers;,
the &whichfullrel; full release in the
<![ %earlyrel; [new]]>
XFree86 4 series.

Update releases are taken from a stable/maintenance branch.  They are
designed to be installed on top of the full release that they are
updating.  They contain fixes for serious problems, most commonly
fixes for security issues, fixes for driver bugs, and fixes that improve
stability.
]]>

<![ %fullrel [
XFree86 &relvers; is the &whichfullrel; full release in the
<![ %earlyrel; [new]]>
XFree86 4 series.
]]>

<p>
XFree86 release 4 is a major re-design of the basic architectural
underpinnings of XFree86's implementation of the original X Consortium's
X Server.  This re-design allows for a modular interaction between the
hardware drivers and the XFree86 core X server.  With 4.x, upgrades to
the X server with new and unsupported hardware can be easily done and
installed without undergoing the previous process of rebuilding an X
server.  All that is required is installing the new driver module and
updating the configuration file.

The road to XFree86 release 4 began as an architectural concept in mid
1997, with the serious framework being implemented in code the beginning
of 1998.  There were several snapshots on the road to 4.0 which are now
part of the 4.0 base release.
<![ %fullrel [The &relvers; version is an upgrade to
&prevrelvers;, which include more hardware ports, code enhancements and
bug fixes.]]>

Release 4 also included the long-awaited integration of the DRI (Direct
Rendering Infrastructure).  This upgrade into the code base  gives
XFree86 the abilities of accelerated direct 3-D graphics rendering, used
widely in games and other visualization programs.

While some driver available in the old 3.3.x release series have not
been converted over to the 4.x series, those required for most modern
video hardware are available.  Please check the <htmlurl name="Driver
Status document" url="Status.html"> first to see whether your hardware
is supported before upgrading to the 4.x series.

<![ %haverelnotes [
Specific release enhancements can be viewed in the
<htmlurl name="Release Notes" url="RELNOTES.html">.
]]>

The XFree86 version numbering system has had some changes as of the
4.0.2 release.  Information about this can be found in the
<htmlurl name="Versions Document" url="Versions.html">.

Information about binary distributions and the attendant installation
instructions can be found in the <htmlurl name="Installation Document"
url="Install.html">.

Copyright and Licensing information for this release and all XFree86
releases can be found in the <htmlurl name="License Document"
url="LICENSE.html">.

<![ %snapshot [
<sect>Redistribution of the Snapshots
<p>

While the XFree86 <htmlurl name="License" url="LICENSE.html"> doesn't
prohibit vendors and others redistributing binaries of this release, we
don't recommend it.  We ask that if you do distribute such binaries,
you make it clear that people using then should contact you for support
and not XFree86.
]]>

<sect>Joining The Team
<sect1> Development
<p>

If you would like to work on the development of XFree86 4, either by
helping with the conversion of our older drivers to the new 4.x design,
or assisting in the addition of new drivers or platforms to the code base
then send a request to <url name="join the XFree86 development team"
url="http://www.xfree86.org:/developer.html">.  This will give you direct
access to the latest XFree86 related development topics and discussions.
Include in your note, your name, email address, reason for joining (what
you will work on) and, level of expertise (coder, DRI, core, specific
driver) and area of interest.

</sect1>


<sect1> Documentation
<p>
If instead your interests are on the Documentation side of the Project,
or you want to contribute and are not ready for plunging into the code,
you can join the Documentation Team (those hardy souls responsible for
the content you are reading :-).  Amongst the Doc Team's activities are
converting our SGML based documentation into an XML based one and updating
and creating technical documentation used by staff and public.  If this
sounds interesting then please send a request to <url name="join the
XFree86 documentation team" url="mailto:signup@xfree86.org">.
Include in your note, you name, email address, reason for joining (what
you will work on) and level of expertise and whether you are interested
in the tools or content side of the group.

</sect1>
</sect> 

<sect> The Public Mailing Lists
<sect1>  Newbie
<p> 
For those who are new to XFree86  and want to learn more about our
Project we recommend that you join our Newbie list, located at <url name
= "Public Mailing Lists" url = "http://www.xfree86.org/mailman/listinfo">,
where this and other discussions occur with our senior all-volunteer
staff.  This is great forum to get introduced to XFree86 and ask for
help on how to set up the XServer or whether your hardware is supported,
and why not?,  and make suggestions for future releases of XFree86.
This list is supported by our volunteer staff who needs to know how you
are using and interacting with XFree86 and what is wrong and could be
better.  Tell them, they want to know!

</sect1>

<sect1> Announce
<p>
For those who just want to know  the release schedule 
this is a good list  to join.

<sect1> CVS Commit
<p>
For those who want to see what has been committed recently to our CVS
repository this is the list that will show you those updates.  This list
is updated dynamically every time the repository is updated after the
the commit happens.

<!--
<p>
A followup to the commit list is the soon to be public, patch archives.
This archive will be available on our web-site and will show what patches
have been submitted and will soon be committed.  This is helpful for
people who are interested in a specific area and want to know what work
is happening there.  When this goes public we will announce it
on our web site and our Announce mailing list, so keep watching.
-->


<sect1>  Xpert
<p>
If instead you are the lone developer who is improving XFree86 on an
ad hoc basis for your particular environment (I want to get my mouse or
video card to work), and need a specific question asked then you should
go over to our Xpert list where such questions are raised and answered
by our technical development staff.  Remember you do not have to be a
member to write fixes to our code base and if your changes are discrete
and self-contained the volume of developer mail may just be too noisy.


Once your work is finished (coded, debugged and documented) please send
your fix to <email>fixes@XFree86.org</email>.  This will ensure that
they are included in future releases. And thanks!  You make this truly
an Open group.

<![ %release; [
XFree86 &relvers; can be found at the <url name="XFree86 ftp server"
url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/&relvers;/">,
and at mirrors of this server.  Information about obtaining and installing
binary distributions of this release can be found in the
<htmlurl name="Installation Document" url="Install.html">.  Information about
obtaining the release in source form is given below.
]]>

<![ %updaterel; [
The source for version &relvers; is available as a patch relative to
&prevrelvers;.
The patch file is <tt>&prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff.gz</tt>.

The patch
should be applied to a clean &prevrelvers; source tree, working from
the directory containing the <tt>xc/</tt> directory.  The patch should
be applied by running:

<tscreen><verb>
gzip -d &lt; &prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff.gz | patch -p0 -E
</verb></tscreen>

Information about getting the source for &prevrelvers can be found in the
README file for that version, which can be found on the
<url name="XFree86 web site" url="http://www.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/&prevrelvers;/README.html">.

<![ %fullrel [
The source for version &fullrelvers; is split into three tarballs:
<tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-1.tgz</tt>, <tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-2.tgz</tt>,
<tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-3.tgz</tt>.  The first contains everything except the
fonts and general X11 documentation.  It is sufficient for building
XFree86 if you already have a set of fonts.  The second contains the
fonts and the source for the general X11 documentation.  The third
contains the general X11 documentation in hardcopy format.

The contrib part of the distribution was folded into the main source
tree a while ago, so a separate contrib tarball is not required.

To format the XFree86 documentation use the latest version of our doctools
package available as <tt>doctools-&doctoolsvers;.tgz</tt>.

<sect>Reporting Bugs
<p>

Bugs should be reported to <email>XFree86@XFree86.org</email>.  Before
reporting bugs, please check the X server log file, which can be found
at <tt>/var/log/XFree86.0.log</tt> on most platforms.  If you can't
resolve the problem yourself, send the entire log file with your bug
report but not the operating system core dump.  Do not edit  the log
file as our developers use it to reproduce and debug your problem.
