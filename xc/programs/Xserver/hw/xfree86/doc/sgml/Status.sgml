<abstract>

This document provides information about the status of the driver and
hardware support in XFree86 &relvers; compared with that in XFree86
&legacyvers;.  Please send updates for this document to

<toc>

<sect>Introduction
<p>
This document contains one section per vendor (organised alphabetically)
for each chipset family that is supported in XFree86 &legacyvers; or
XFree86 &relvers;.  It includes information about the status of the
drivers and the hardware they support, including a comparison of the
level of support between versions &legacyvers; and &relvers;.

In XFree86 &legacyvers;, several X servers are available; much hardware
uses the XF86_SVGA server, which has a set of driver modules that are built
into it at compile time.  In other cases, X servers for specific chips (or
families of chips) are provided (such as XF86_AGX, XF86_Mach64, etc.).

In XFree86 &relvers;, there is only one X server, called "XFree86", which
can load driver modules at runtime.  Thus there is no specific mention of a
server binary when &relvers; is discussed; only the XFree86 server is
used.  Third-party vendors (often the manufacturers of various video
chipsets) may provide their own drivers for the XFree86 server, but these
third-party modules are beyond the scope of this document.

NOTE: Status information needs to be checked carefully and expanded where
possible.  E.g., include information about acceleration, multi-head, known
problems, hardware known to work on, platform dependencies/limitations,
other architectures known to work on (e.g., Alpha, PPC), etc.

	Support for Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo 2 chips is available on
	platforms where Glide is available (Linux and FreeBSD(?)) and is
	provided by the "glide" driver (requires version 2.x of the Glide
	library, which is not part of the XFree86 distribution).

	Support (including acceleration) for Voodoo Banshee, Voodoo3,

	Support for the Video 7 chipset is provided by the XF86_SVGA
