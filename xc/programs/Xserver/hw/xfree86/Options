Disables accelerated rectangular expansion blits from source patterns \
stored in system memory (one scan line at a time).

xaa.XaaNoScanlineImageWriteRect:\
Disables acclerated transfers of full-color rectangular patterns from \
system memory to video memory (one scan line at a time).

xaa.XaaNoScreenToScreenColorExpandFill:\
Disables accelerated rectangular expansion blits from source patterns \
stored in offscreen video memory.

!! FBDev options
fbdev.fbdev:\
The framebuffer device to use. \
Default: /dev/fb0.

fbdev.ShadowFB:\
Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer. \
Default: on.


!! MGA options
mga.ColorKey:\
Set the colormap index used for the transparency key for the depth 8 plane \
when operating in 8+24 overlay mode. The value must be in the range 2-255. \
Default: 255.

mga.HWcursor:\
Enable or disable the HW cursor. Default: on.

mga.MGASDRAM:\
Specify whether G100, G200 or G400 cards have SDRAM. The driver attempts to \
auto-detect this based on the card's PCI subsystem ID. This option may be \
used to override that auto-detection. The mga driver is not able to \
auto-detect the presence of of SDRAM on secondary heads in multihead \
configurations so this option will often need to be specified in multihead \
configurations. Default: autodetected.

mga.NoAccel:\
Disable or enable acceleration. Default: acceleration is enabled.

mga.OverclockMem:\
Set clocks to values used by some commercial X-Servers (G100, G200 and \
G400 only). Default: off.

mga.Overlay:\
Enable 8+24 overlay mode. Only appropriate for depth 24. (Note: the G100 is \
unaccelerated in the 8+24 overlay mode due to a missing hardware feature). \
Default: off.

mga.PciRetry:\
Enable or disable PCI retries. Default: off.

mga.Rotate:\
Rotate the display clockwise or counterclockwise. This mode is unaccelerated. \
Default: no rotation.

mga.ShadowFB:\
Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer. See shadowfb(4) for \
further information. Default: off.

mga.SyncOnGreen:\
Enable or disable combining the sync signals with the green signal. \
Default: off.

mga.UseFBDev:\
Enable or disable use of on OS-specific fb interface (and is not supported \
on all OSs). See fbdevhw(4) for further information. Default: off.

mga.VideoKey:\
This sets the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key. \
Default: undefined.

mga.TexturedVideo:\
This has XvImage support use the texture engine rather than the video \
overlay. This option is only supported by the G200 and G400, and only in \
16 and 32 bits per pixel. Default: off.


!! R128 options

r128.SWcursor: \
Selects software cursor. \
Default: off.

r128.NoAccel:\
Enables or disables all hardware acceleration. \
Default: on.

r128.Dac6Bit:\
Enables or disables the use of 6 bits per color component when in 8 bpp \
mode (emulates VGA mode). \
Default: off.

r128.VideoKey:\
This overrides the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key. \
Default: undefined.

r128.Display:\
Select display mode for devices which support flat panels. Supported\
modes are "FP", "CRT", "Mirror", "BIOS". \
Default: "FP".

r128.ProgramFPRegs:\
Enable or disable programming of the flat panel registers.\
Beware that this may damage your panel, so use at your own risk. \
Default: device dependant.

r128.PanelWidth:\
Override flat panel width in pixels. \
Default: determined using BIOS.

r128.PanelHeight:\
Override flat panel height in pixels. \
Default: determined using BIOS.

r128.UseFBDev:\
Enable or disable use of on OS-specific fb interface (and is not supported \
on all OSs). See fbdevhw(4) for further information. Default: off.


!! Vesa options
vesa.ShadowFB:\
Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer. See shadowfb(4)\
for further information. Default: on.
