STATUS as of Tue,  8 May 2001 19:01:39 +0200
  
Working :
  * Unaccelerated : Depth 8, 15, 16 and 24 are ok. I tested them upto
    1280x1024 only as my monitor don't support higher modes.
  * Endianess clean, thanks to Romain Dolbeau <dolbeaur@club-internet.fr> for
    helping me debug this.
  * HW cursor.
  * ShadowFb.
  * Full 2D Accels.
    - Sync.
    - Pixmap cache.
    - Offscreen pixmaps.
    - Clipping.
    - Screen to screen copy. 
    - Solid fills.
    - HorVert Solid Lines .
    - 8x8 Mono Pattern Fills.
    - Color Expansion Fills.
    - Images Writes.
    - Bitmap Writes using direct FIFO writes with or without FIFO Disconnect.
    - Pixmap Writes using direct FIFO writes with or without FIFO Disconnect.
  * Appian J2000 second head initialization.
  * Xv : Hardware video scaler :
    - Needs checking on a big endian machine.
    - Needs acceleration to work - there is a hardware bug in YV12 mode.
    - Support both dual head and single head, trough gamma or permedia3.
    - NOTE: depth 15 and 16 currently broken as I can't figure out the
      colorKey equation. From the docs it needs to be padded to 8bits per RGB,
      but that doesn't seem to work either. FIXME.
    - Attributes are :
      - FILTER : None, Partial (X only) or Full filtering.
      - COLORKEY : Speaks for itself
      - DOUBLE_BUFFER : Speaks for itself
      - AUTOPAINT_COLORKEY : Speaks for itself
      - MIRROR : X and/or Y Axis mirroring. (NOT DONE)
      - ALPHA : (NOT DONE)
        - 0 -> FB Only
        - 1 -> 25% Video, 75% FB
        - 2 -> 75% Video, 25% FB
        - 3 -> Video Only
  * DRI : Work is underway.

Not Working :

  * [NOT POSSIBLE] 2D Accel :
    - Solid & Dashed Lines are not possible on glint hardware.
    - 8x8 Color Pattern Fill is almost never used.
    - Clipping needs cleaning up.
  * [TODO] 2D Accel hooks for the Rendering extension :
    - Render extension initialization.
    - CPUToScreenTexture.
    - CPUToScreenAlphaTexture.
  * [WORK IS UNDERWAY] DRI/OpenGL (only together with a gamma chip) :
    - DRI support should be ok, but accelerated openGL is not yet supported. 
    - The accelerated OpenGL library supposes we are using a gamma together
      with a MX rasterizer, not a Permedia3 one.

Known problems :

  * [FIXED] R-B inversion. Sometimes, all of a sudden, it seems as the
    RGB order gets changed. going to console and back solves this.
    Well, this is partly fixed, but still appears under very heavy load.
 => [NOTE] If this still happens, try disabling the Hardware cursor, with
    the "SWCursor" option to your device XF86Config section.
 => [NOTE2] Or, try starting the Xserver with the -nosilk option.
