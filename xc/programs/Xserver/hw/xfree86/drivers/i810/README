		      Information for i810 Users
		      i810 Driver Version 2.0.0


1. Supported Hardware

   * Intel 810 motherboards:
	i810, 
	i810-dc100, 
	i810e.


2. Features

   * Full support for 8, 15, 16 and 24 bit per pixel depths.
   * Hardware cursor support to reduce sprite flicker.
   * Hardware accelerated 2D drawing engine support for 8, 15, 16 and
     24 bit per pixel depths.
   * Support for high resolution video modes up to 1600x1200.
   * Fully programmable clock supported.
   * Robust text mode restore for VT switching.


3. Technical Notes

   * Hardware acceleration is not possible in 32 bit per pixel depth, 
     and this mode is not supported by this driver.
   * Interlace modes cannot be supported.
   * Normal use requires the agpgart.o module, included in linux kernels 
     2.3.42 and higher.


4. Reported Working Video Cards

   * Intel evaluation hardware - i810, i810-dc100 and i810e.
   * Tyan Tomcat Motherboard.
   * HappyPC set-top box.

5. Configuration

   The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to
   initialize the card.  The only lines you need in the "Device"
   section of your XF86Config file are:

       Section "Device"
           Identifier "i810"
       EndSection

   If you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:

       DacSpeed - in MHz
       MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer
       IOBase   - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers


   In order to use most resolutions, it is necessary to install the
   'agpgart.o' module which accompanies this server.  You will probably
   have to compile the module yourself (see the notes in the module).

   Note: the i810 X server detects whether your motherboard has
	display cache video memory.  This memory is has reduced bandwidth
	compared to normal system memory, and isn't used by the server.  The
	main function of this memory is for ancillary buffers (eg. z buffer)
	in a forthcoming 3d capable server.


6. Driver Options

   "no_accel"  - software rendering only


7. Known Limitations

   - No 3d support in this release.
   - No 32bpp support in this driver.
   - Running Two Xservers on different VT's is not supported at this time.
