XCOMM mergelib - merge one library into another; this is commonly used by X
XCOMM     to add the extension library into the base Xlib.

XCOMM
XCOMM Create a temp directory, and figure out how to reference the 
XCOMM object files from it (i.e. relative vs. absolute path names).
XCOMM

tmpdir=tmp.$$
origdir=..

mkdir $tmpdir

if [ ! -d $tmpdir ]; then
    echo "$0:  unable to create temporary directory $tmpdir" 1>&2
    exit 1

XCOMM
XCOMM In the temp directory, extract all of the object files and prefix
XCOMM them with some symbol to avoid name clashes with the base library.
XCOMM
cd $tmpdir
ar x ${upfrom}$fromlib
for i in *.o; do
    mv $i ${objprefix}$i
done


XCOMM
XCOMM Merge in the object modules, ranlib (if appropriate) and cleanup
XCOMM
ARCMD ${upto}$tolib *.o
RANLIB ${upto}$tolib
cd $origdir
rm -rf $tmpdir
