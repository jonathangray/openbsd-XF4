			Fontconfig
	Font configuration and customization library
		      Version 2.2.2
		         2004-3-10

This is the third public release of fontconfig, a font configuration and
customization library.  Fontconfig is designed to locate fonts within the
system and select them according to requirements specified by applications.

Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a particular
rasterization library on the application.  The X-specific library
'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and rasterize fonts.

Version 2.2.2

Update #includes for newer versions of FreeType

Version 2.2.1

Allows executable names for autotools to be specified in environment
variables.

Close some SGML tags in the documentation.

Fix a catastrophic bug in pattern editing code

Fix a typo "bitsteam" -> "bitstream"

Let FreeType compute slant for type1 fonts instead of poking at the
italic_angle value.

Fix language comparison function.
