Here is a list of items that need to be addressed in FreeType 2:

* Add synthesized Unicode charmap processing to the CFF driver.

* Fix Visual C++ project file

* Fix a bug in the TrueType driver: linear horizontal advances of composites
  are not returned properly.

* Change the build system to work with the "Jam" tool instead of the
  terribly complex and error-prone GNU Makefiles we're currently using
