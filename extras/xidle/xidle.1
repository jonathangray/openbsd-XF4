.Sh NAME
.Nm xidle
.Nd run a program on X inactivity
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm xidle
.Op Fl display Ar display
.Op Fl nw | ne | sw | se
.Op Fl program Ar path
.Op Fl timeout Ar seconds
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
uses the
.Xr XScreenSaver 3
extension to receive inactivity events when a timeout is specified, running
a specific program after the elapsed time.
.Nm
also monitors the very corner of the given position in a 2x2 pixel
area for pointer activity and runs a program if the pointer sits there
for more than 2 seconds.
This behavior is always present, whether
.Fl timeout
is specified or not.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width timeout
.It Fl display Ar display
This argument allows you to specify the server to connect to; see
.Xr X 7 .
.It Fl nw | ne | sw | se
Set the position to one of northwest, northeast, southwest, or southeast,
respectively.
If no position is specified,
the default is northwest.
.It Fl program Ar path
Specify the full pathname of the program to run on any of the
aforementioned events.
Arguments to the program may also be specified, separated by whitespace.
If
.Fl program
is not specified, the default is
.Xr xlock 1 .
.It Fl timeout Ar seconds
Set the timeout to the specified number of seconds.
If
.Fl timeout
is not specified,
.Nm
won't run any program on inactivity.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Run
.Xr xlock 1
using the flying bats mode if no activity is detected in 300 seconds or the
pointer sits in the southwest corner for more than 2 seconds:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ xidle -sw -program "/usr/X11R6/bin/xlock -mode bat" -timeout 300
.Pp
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr xlock 1 ,
.Xr XScreenSaver 3 ,
.Xr X 7
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
program was written by Federico Schwindt as an xautolock replacement.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
does not support resources (yet).
.Pp
The maximum number of arguments for
.Fl program ,
including the executable file, is currently set to 9.
