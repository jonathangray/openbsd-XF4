Post-installation instructions for XFree86 on OpenBSD/powerpc
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Xmacppc server is an unaccelerated, 8 bits only server, based on
the Xsun code.  It doesn't require any special configuration file. 

To select the mode it will be using, you have to use MacOS 
or the OpenFirmware. 

SUPPORTED HARDWARE

This server has been tested on iMac, and G4 hardware, with resolutions 
of 1024x768 and 1280x1024. 

All 8 bits capable PCI VGA display adapters supported by OpenFirmare 
should work.

Only US keyboards are supported by default. To use other keymaps, define
them using xmodmap(1).

FUTURE WORK

There is ongoing work to get XFree86 4 working on OpenBSD/powerpc on 
PCI VGA boards. This will should higher color depths, acceleration 
and more.
